Nuclear_Overhauser_effect Chemical_physics Science,the nuclear overhauser effect noe is the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from one nuclear spin population to another via cross relaxation it is a common phenomenon observed by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy the theoretical basis for the noe was described and experimentally verified by anderson and in the noe is an extension of the seminal work of american physicist albert overhauser who in proposed that nuclear spin polarization could be enhanced by the microwave irradiation of the conduction electrons in certain metals the general overhauser effect was first demonstrated experimentally by t r carver and c p slichter also in another early explanation and experimental observation of the noe was by in in an nmr experiment where the spin polarization was transferred from one population of nuclear spins to another rather than from electrons spins to nuclear spins however the theoretical basis and the applicable solomon equations had already been published by solomon in subsequent to its discovery the noe was shown to be highly useful in nmr spectroscopy for characterizing and organic chemical structures in this application the noe differs from the application of spin spin coupling in that the noe occurs through space not through chemical bonds thus atoms that are in close to each other can give a noe whereas spin coupling is observed only when the atoms are connected by chemical bonds the inter atomic distances derived from the observed noe can often help to confirm a precise molecular conformation i e the three dimensional structure of a molecule in was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for demonstrating that the noe could be using two dimensional nmr spectroscopy to determine the three dimensional structures of biological macromolecules in solution,Science,1
Quantum_solvent Chemical_physics Science,a quantum solvent is essentially a superfluid a quantum liquid used to another chemical species any superfluid can theoretically act as a quantum solvent however in practice the only viable superfluid medium that can currently be used is helium and it has been successfully accomplished in controlled conditions such solvents are currently under investigation for use in spectroscopic techniques in the field of analytical chemistry due to their kinetic properties any matter or otherwise suspended in the superfluid will to aggregate together in by a quantum solvation shell due to the totally nature of the superfluid medium the entire object then proceeds to act very much like a ball allowing effectively complete rotational freedom of the chemical species a quantum solvation shell consists of a region of non superfluid helium atoms that the molecule s and exhibit following around the centre of gravity of the as such the kinetics of an effectively molecule can be studied without the need to use an actual gas which can be impractical or impossible it is necessary to make a small to the rotational constant of the chemical species being examined in order to compensate for the higher mass by the quantum solvation shell quantum solvation has so far been achieved with a number of organic and compounds and it has been that as well as the obvious use in the field of spectroscopy quantum solvents could be used as tools in chemical engineering perhaps to components for use in nanotechnology,Science,2
Rovibrational_coupling Chemical_physics Science,coupling is a coupled rotational and vibrational excitation of a molecule it is different from coupling which involves a change in all of electronic vibrational and rotational states simultaneously rotational vibrational spectroscopy generally vibrational transitions occur in conjunction with rotational transitions consequently it is possible to observe both rotational and vibrational transitions in the vibrational spectrum although many methods are available for observing vibrational spectra the two most common methods are infrared spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy formula where formula is the vibrational quantum number formula is the rotational quantum number h is planck s constant formula is the frequency of the vibration formula is the speed of light and formula is the rotational constant spectra the selection rule for the absorption of dipole radiation the strongest component of light is that formula this is because of the vector addition properties of quantum mechanical angular momenta and because light particles photons have angular momenta of in spectroscopy the transitions where formula are referred to as the p branch transitions with formula are referred to as q branch and formula as r branch for linear molecules the most commonly observed case is that only transitions with formula are observed this is only possible when the molecule has a ground state that is there are no unpaired electron spins in the molecule for molecules that do have unpaired electrons q branches see below are commonly observed the gap between the r and p branches is known as the q branch a peak would appear here for a vibrational transition in which the rotational energy did not change formula however according to the quantum mechanical rigid rotor model upon which rotational spectroscopy is based there is a spectroscopic selection rule that requires that formula this selection rule explains the p and r branches are observed but not the q branch as well as branches for which formula formula etc the positions of the peaks in the spectrum can be predicted using the rigid rotor model one prediction of the rigid rotor model is that the space between each of the peaks should be formula where formula is the rotational constant for a given molecule experimentally it is observed that the spacing between the r branch peaks decreases as the frequency increases similarly the spacing between the p branch peaks increases as the frequency decreases this variation in the spacing results from the bonds between the atoms in a molecule not being rigid formula formula rotational vibrational spectra will also show some fine structure due to the presence of different isotopes in the spectrum in the spectrum shown above all of the rotational peaks are slightly into two peaks one peak corresponds to and the other to the ratio of the peak intensities corresponds to the natural abundance of these two isotopes,Science,3
Effective_field_theory Chemical_physics Science,in physics an effective field theory is as any effective theory an approximate theory usually a quantum field theory that includes appropriate degrees of freedom to describe physical phenomena occurring at a chosen length scale while and degrees of freedom at shorter distances or at higher energies the renormalization group presently effective field theories are discussed in the context of the renormalization group rg where the process of out short distance degrees of freedom is made systematic although this method is not sufficiently to allow the actual construction of effective field theories the understanding of their becomes clear through a rg analysis this method also to the main technique of effective field theories through the analysis of symmetries if there is a single mass scale m in the microscopic theory then the effective field theory can be seen as an expansion in m the construction of an effective field theory accurate to some power of m requires a new set of free parameters at each order of the expansion in m this technique is useful for scattering or other processes where the maximum momentum scale k satisfies the condition k since effective field theories are not valid at small length scales they need not be renormalizable indeed the ever expanding number of parameters at each order in m required for an effective field theory means that they are generally not renormalizable in the same sense as quantum electrodynamics which requires only the renormalization of three parameters examples of effective field theories fermi theory of beta this theory a interaction between the four fermions involved in these reactions the theory had great success and was eventually understood to arise from the gauge theory of interactions which forms a part of the standard model of particle physics in this more fundamental theory the interactions are by a changing gauge boson the the success of the fermi theory was because the w particle has mass of about gev whereas the early experiments were all done at an energy scale of less than mev such a separation of scales by over orders of magnitude has not been met in any other situation as yet bcs theory of superconductivity another famous example is the bcs theory of superconductivity here the underlying theory is of electrons in a metal interacting with lattice vibrations called phonons the phonons cause attractive interactions between some electrons causing them to form pairs the length scale of these pairs is much larger than the wavelength of phonons making it possible to neglect the dynamics of phonons and construct a theory in which two electrons effectively interact at a point this theory has had remarkable success in describing and predicting the results of experiments other examples presently effective field theories are written for many situations,Science,4
Chemical_physics Chemical_physics Science,chemical physics is a of chemistry and physics that phenomena using techniques from atomic and molecular physics and condensed matter physics it is the branch of physics that studies chemical processes from the point of view of physics while at the interface of physics and chemistry chemical physics is distinct from physical chemistry in that it focuses more on the characteristic elements and theories of physics meanwhile physical chemistry studies the physical nature of chemistry the distinction between the two fields is and workers often practice in each field during the course of their research,Science,5
Rotational_transition Chemical_physics Science,a rotational transition is an change in angular momentum in quantum physics like all other properties of a quantum particle angular momentum is quantized meaning it can only equal certain discrete values which correspond to different rotational energy states when a particle angular momentum it is said to have to a lower rotational energy state likewise when a particle gains angular momentum a positive rotational transition is said to have occurred rotational transitions are important in physics due to the unique spectral lines that result because there is a net gain or loss of energy during a transition electromagnetic radiation of a particular frequency must be absorbed or emitted this forms spectral lines at that frequency which can be detected with a as in rotational spectroscopy or raman spectroscopy,Science,6
Dynamic_nuclear_polarisation Chemical_physics Science,dynamic nuclear polarization dnp results from spin polarization from electrons to nuclei aligning the nuclear spins to the extent that electron spins are aligned note that the alignment of electron spins at a given magnetic field and temperature is described by the boltzmann distribution under the thermal equilibrium see figure it is also possible that those electrons are aligned to a higher degree of order by other of electron spin order such as chemical reactions leading to chemical induced dnp optical and spin dnp is considered one of several techniques for when electron spin polarization from its thermal equilibrium value polarization between electrons and nuclei can occur spontaneously through electron nuclear cross relaxation and or spin state mixing among electrons and nuclei for example the polarization transfer is after a chemical reaction on the other hand when the electron spin system is in a thermal equilibrium the polarization transfer requires continuous microwave irradiation at a frequency close to the corresponding electron paramagnetic resonance epr frequency in particular mechanisms for the microwave driven dnp processes are into the overhauser effect the solid effect the cross effect and thermal mixing the first dnp experiments were performed in the early at low magnetic fields but until recently the technique was of limited applicability for high frequency high field nmr spectroscopy because of the lack of microwave sources operating at the appropriate frequency today such sources are available as turn key instruments making dnp a valuable and indispensable method especially in the field of structure determination by high resolution solid state nmr spectroscopy dnp mechanisms the overhauser effect dnp was first realized using the concept of the overhauser effect which is the perturbation of nuclear spin level populations observed in metals and free radicals when electron spin transitions are by the microwave irradiation this effect relies on stochastic interactions between an electron and a nucleus the dynamic initially to highlight the time dependent and random interactions in this polarization transfer process the dnp phenomenon was theoretically predicted by albert overhauser in and initially some criticism from ramsey and other renowned physicists of the time on the grounds of being the experimental by carver and slichter as well as an from ramsey both reached overhauser in the same year the so called electron nucleus cross relaxation which is responsible for the dnp phenomenon is caused by rotational and translational modulation of the electron nucleus hyperfine coupling the theory of this process is based essentially on the second order time dependent perturbation theory solution of the von equation for the spin density matrix while the overhauser effect relies on time dependent electron nuclear interactions the remaining polarizing mechanisms rely on time independent electron nuclear and electron electron interactions the solid effect the solid effect occurs when the electron nucleus mutual flip transition in an electron nucleus two spin system is excited by microwave irradiation this polarizing mechanism is optimal when the exciting microwave frequency shifts up or down by the nuclear larmor frequency from the electron larmor frequency in the discussed two spin system the direction of frequency shifts corresponds to the sign of dnp enhancements therefore to the between positive and negative dnp enhancements it requires that the linewidth of the epr spectrum of involved unpaired electrons is smaller than the nuclear larmor frequency note that the transition moment for the above microwave excitation results from a second order effect of the electron nuclear interactions and thus requires stronger microwave power to be significant and its intensity is by an increase of the external magnetic field as a result the dnp enhancement from the solid effect scales as the cross effect the cross effect requires two unpaired electrons as the source of high polarization while the underlying physics is still of second order nature with respect to the electron electron and electron nuclear interactions the polarizing efficiency can be improved with the optimized epr frequency separation of the two electrons close to the nuclear larmor frequency as a result the strength of microwave irradiation is less than that in the solid effect in practice the correct epr frequency separation is accomplished through random orientation of paramagnetic species with g anisotropy depending on the probability of desired frequency separation from an broadened epr lineshape whose linewidth is than the nuclear larmor frequency therefore as this linewidth is proportional to external magnetic field the overall dnp efficiency or the enhancement of nuclear polarization scales as thermal mixing thermal mixing is an energy exchange phenomena between the electron spin ensemble and the nuclear spin which can be thought of as using multiple electron spins to provide nuclear polarization note that the electron spin ensemble acts as a whole because of stronger inter electron interactions the strong interactions lead to a broadened epr lineshape of the involved paramagnetic species the linewidth is optimized for polarization transfer from electrons to nuclei when it is close to the nuclear larmor frequency the optimization is related to an three spin electron electron nucleus process that the coupled three spins under the energy conservation mainly of the zeeman interactions due to the inhomogeneous component of the associated epr lineshape the dnp enhancement by this mechanism also scales as,Science,7
Knight_shift Chemical_physics Science,the knight shift is a shift in the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency of a paramagnetic first published in by the american physicist walter david knight the knight shift refers to the relative shift k in nmr frequency for atoms in a metal e g sodium compared with the same atoms in a nonmetallic environment e g sodium chloride the observed shift reflects the local magnetic field produced at the sodium nucleus by the of the conduction electrons the average local field in sodium the applied resonance field by approximately one part per in nonmetallic sodium chloride the local field is negligible in comparison the knight shift is due to the conduction electrons in metals they an extra effective field at the nuclear site due to the spin of the conduction electrons in the presence of an external field this is responsible for the shift observed in the nuclear magnetic resonance the shift from two sources one is the pauli paramagnetic spin susceptibility the other is the s component at the nucleus depending on the electronic structure the knight shift may be temperature dependent however in metals which normally have a broad electronic density of states knight shifts are temperature independent,Science,8
Polarizability Chemical_physics Science,is the measure of the change in a molecule s electron distribution in response to an applied electric field which can also be induced by electric interactions with solvents or ionic it is a property of matter polarizabilities determine the dynamical response of a bound system to external fields and provide insight into a molecule s internal structure electric polarizability definition electric polarizability is the relative tendency of a charge distribution like the electron cloud of an atom or molecule to be distorted from its normal shape by an external electric field which is applied typically by the molecule in a charged parallel plate but may also be caused by the presence of a nearby ion or dipole the electronic polarizability formula is defined as the ratio of the induced dipole moment formula of an atom to the electric field formula that produces this dipole moment formula polarizability has the units of but is more often expressed as polarizability volume with units of or in formula where formula is the vacuum the polarizability of individual particles is related to the average electric susceptibility of the medium by the relation note that the polarizability formula as defined above is a scalar quantity this implies that the applied electric fields can only produce polarization components parallel to the field for example an electric field in the formula direction can only produce an formula component in formula however it can that an electric field in the formula direction produces a formula or formula component in the vector formula in this case formula is described as a tensor of rank which is represented with respect to a given system of axes frame of reference by a formula matrix generally polarizability increases as volume occupied by electrons increases in atoms this occurs because larger atoms have more loosely held electrons in contrast to smaller atoms with tightly bound electrons on rows of the periodic table polarizability therefore decreases from left to right polarizability increases down on columns of the periodic table likewise larger molecules are generally more polarizable than smaller ones though water is a very polar molecule alkanes and other hydrophobic molecules are more polarizable alkanes are the most polarizable molecules although and are expected to have larger polarizability than alkanes because of their higher reactivity compared to alkanes alkanes are in fact more polarizable this results because of s and s more electronegative carbons to the s less electronegative carbons it is important to note that ground state electron configuration models are often in studying the polarizability of bonds because dramatic changes in molecular structure occur in a reaction magnetic polarizability magnetic polarizability defined by spin interactions of nucleons is an important parameter of and in particular measurement of tensor polarizabilities of nucleons yields important information about spin dependent nuclear forces the method of spin amplitudes uses quantum mechanics to more easily describe spin dynamics vector and tensor polarization of particle nuclei with spin are specified by the unit polarization vector formula and the polarization tensor p additional of products of three or more spin matrices are needed only for the description of polarization of particles nuclei with spin polarizability of the nucleon the polarizabilities belong to the fundamental structure constants of the nucleon in addition to the mass the electric charge the spin and the magnetic moment the to measure the polarizabilities back to the two experimental options were considered i compton scattering by the proton and ii the scattering of slow neutrons in the coulomb field of heavy nuclei the idea was that the nucleon with its pion cloud obtains an electric dipole moment under the action of an electric field vector which is proportional to the electric polarizability after the discovery of the of the resonance it became obvious that the nucleon also should have a strong paramagnetic polarizability because of a virtual spin flip transition of one of the constituent quarks due to the magnetic field vector provided by a real photon in a compton scattering experiment however experiments showed that this expected strong paramagnetism is not observed apparently a strong diamagnetism exists which the expected strong paramagnetism though this explanation is it remained unknown how it may be understood in terms of the structure of the nucleon a solution of this problem was found very recently when it was shown that the diamagnetism is a property of the structure of the constituent quarks in this is not a because constituent quarks generate their mass mainly through interactions with the vacuum via the exchange of a meson this is predicted by the linear model on the quark level which also predicts the mass of the meson to be mev the meson has the capability of interacting with two photons being in parallel planes of linear polarization we will show in the following that the meson as part of the constituent quark structure therefore provides the part of the electric polarizability and the total diamagnetic polarizability definition of electromagnetic polarizabilities a nucleon in an electric field e and a magnetic field h obtains an electric dipole moment d and magnetic dipole moment m given by in a unit system where the electric charge formula is given by formula the proportionality constants formula and formula are denoted as the electric and magnetic polarizabilities respectively these polarizabilities may be understood as a measure of the response of the nucleon structure to the fields provided by a real or virtual photon and it is evident that we need a second photon to measure the polarizabilities this may be expressed through the relations where formula is the energy change in the electromagnetic field due to the presence of the nucleon in the field the definition implies that the polarizabilities are measured in units of a volume i e in units of formula m modes of two photon reactions and experimental methods electric fields of sufficient strength are provided by the coulomb field of heavy nuclei therefore the electric polarizability of the neutron can be measured by scattering slow neutrons in the electric field e of a pb nucleus the neutron has no electric charge therefore two simultaneously interacting electric field vectors two virtual photons are required to produce a deflection of the neutron then the electric polarizability can be obtained from the differential cross section measured at a small deflection angle a further possibility is provided by compton scattering of real photons by the nucleon where during the scattering process two electric and two magnetic field vectors simultaneously interact with the nucleon in the following we discuss the experimental options we have to measure the polarizabilities of the nucleon as above two photons are needed which simultaneously interact with the electrically charged parts of the nucleon these photons may be in parallel or perpendicular planes of linear polarization and in these two modes measure the polarizabilities formula formula or spinpolarizabilities formula respectively the is only for particles having a spin case corresponds to the measurement of the electric polarizability formula via two parallel electric field vectors e these parallel electric field vectors may either be provided as photons by the coulomb field of a heavy nucleus or by compton scattering in the forward direction or by reflecting the photon by real photons simultaneously provide electric e and magnetic h field vectors this means that in a compton scattering experiment linear combinations of electric and magnetic polarizabilities and linear combinations of electric and magnetic spinpolarizabilities are measured the combination of case and case measures formula and is observed in forward direction compton scattering the combination of case and case measures formula and is observed in backward direction compton scattering the combination of case and case measures formula and is observed in forward direction compton scattering the combination of case and case measures formula and is observed in backward direction compton scattering compton scattering experiments exactly in the forward direction and exactly in the backward direction are not possible from a technical point of view therefore the respective quantities have to be extracted from compton scattering experiments carried out at intermediate angles experimental results the experimental polarizabilities of the proton p and the neutron n may be as follows the experimental spinpolarizabilities of the proton p and neutron n are the experimental polarizabilities of the proton have been obtained as an average from a larger number of compton scattering experiments the experimental electric polarizability of the neutron is the average of an experiment on electromagnetic scattering of a neutron in the coulomb field of a pb nucleus and a compton scattering experiment on a neutron i e a neutron separated from a deuteron during the scattering process the two results are see furthermore there are experiments at the university of lund sweden where the electric polarizability of the neutron is determined through compton scattering by the deuteron calculation of polarizabilities recently great progress has been made in disentangling the total photoabsorption cross section into parts separated by the spin the and the parity of the intermediate state using the meson amplitudes of et al the spin of the intermediate state may be formula or formula depending on the spin directions of the photon and the nucleon in the initial state the parity change during the from the ground state to the intermediate state is formula for the multipoles formula and formula for the multipoles formula calculating the respective partial cross from photo meson data the following sum rules can be where formula is the photon energy in the lab frame the sum rules for formula and formula depend on nucleon structure degrees of freedom only whereas the sum rules for formula and formula have to be supplemented by the quantities formula and formula respectively these are formula channel contributions which may be interpreted as contributions of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons being parts of the constituent quark structure the sum rule for formula depends on the total photoabsorption cross section and therefore does not require a disentangling with respect to quantum numbers the sum rule for formula requires a disentangling with respect to the parity change of the transition the sum rule for formula requires a disentangling with respect to the spin of the intermediate state the sum rule for formula requires a disentangling with respect to spin and parity change the formula channel contributions depend on those scalar and pseudoscalar mesons which i are part of the structure of the constituent quarks and ii are capable of coupling to two photons these are the mesons formula formula and formula in case of formula and the mesons formula formula and formula in case of formula the are dominated by the formula and the formula whereas the other mesons only lead to small corrections results of calculation the electric polarizabilities formula and formula are dominated by a smaller component due to the pion cloud nucleon and a larger component due to the formula meson as part of the constituent quark structure const quark the magnetic polarizabilities formula and formula have a large paramagnetic part due to the spin structure of the nucleon nucleon and an only slightly smaller diamagnetic part due to the formula meson as part of the constituent quark structure const quark the contributions of the formula meson are supplemented by small corrections due to formula and formula mesons the spinpolarizabilities formula and formula are dominated by interfering components from the pion cloud and the spin structure of the nucleon the different obtained for the proton and the neutron are due to this destructive interference the spinpolarizabilities formula and formula have a minor component due to the structure of the nucleon nucleon and a major component due to the pseudoscalar mesons formula formula and formula as structure components of the constituent quarks const quark the agreement with the experimental data is excellent in all eight cases in the we have shown that the polarizabilities of the nucleon are well understood from previous the structure of the constituent quark is essential for the and the general properties of the polarizabilities,Science,9
Anisotropic_liquid Chemical_physics Science,an anisotropic liquid is a liquid which has and where the molecules have an average structural order relative to each other along their molecular axis that ordinary do not have liquid are examples of anisotropic liquids,Science,10
Rotating_wave_approximation Chemical_physics Science,the rotating wave approximation is an approximation used in atom and magnetic resonance in this approximation terms in a hamiltonian which oscillate rapidly are neglected this is a valid approximation when the applied electromagnetic radiation is near resonance with an atomic resonance and the intensity is low terms in the which oscillate with frequencies formula are neglected while terms which oscillate with frequencies formula are kept where formula is the light frequency and formula is a transition frequency the name of the approximation from the form of the hamiltonian in the interaction picture as shown below by to this picture the evolution of an atom due to the corresponding atomic hamiltonian is absorbed into the system ket leaving only the evolution due to the interaction of the atom with the light field to consider it is in this picture that the rapidly oscillating terms mentioned previously can be neglected since in some sense the interaction picture can be thought of as rotating with the system ket only that part of the electromagnetic wave that approximately co rotates is kept the rotating component is mathematical formulation for consider a two level atomic system with ground and excited states formula and formula respectively using the notation let the energy difference between the states be formula so that formula is the transition frequency of the system then the hamiltonian of the atom can be written as suppose the atom an external classical electric field of frequency formula given by formula e g a plane wave propagating in space then under the dipole approximation the interaction hamiltonian between the atom and the electric field can be expressed as where formula is the dipole moment operator of the atom the total hamiltonian for the atom light system is therefore formula the atom does not have a dipole moment when it is in an energy so formula this means that defining formula allows the dipole operator to be written as making the approximation this is the point at which the rotating wave approximation is made the dipole approximation has been assumed and for this to remain valid the electric field must be near resonance with the atomic transition this means that formula and the complex formula and formula can be considered to be rapidly oscillating hence on any time scale the oscillations will quickly average to the rotating wave approximation is thus the claim that these terms may be neglected and thus the hamiltonian can be written in the interaction picture as at this point the rotating wave approximation is complete a common first step beyond this is to the remaining time dependence in the hamiltonian via another unitary transformation derivation given the above definitions the interaction hamiltonian is as stated the next step is to find the hamiltonian in the interaction picture formula the required unitary transformation is where the last step can be seen to follow e g from a series expansion and due to the of the states formula and formula we have the atomic hamiltonian was unaffected by the approximation so the total hamiltonian in the picture under the rotating wave approximation is,Science,11
RRKM_theory Chemical_physics Science,the rrkm theory is a theory of chemical reactivity it was developed by and in and in theory and into the rrkm theory in by who took the transition state theory developed by in into account these methods enable the computation of simple of the reaction rates from a few characteristics of the potential energy surface,Science,12
Molecular_vibration Chemical_physics Science,a molecular vibration occurs when atoms in a molecule are in periodic motion while the molecule as a whole has constant translational and rotational motion the frequency of the periodic motion is known as a vibration frequency and the typical frequencies of molecular vibrations range from less than to approximately in general a molecule with n atoms has n normal modes of vibration but a linear molecule has n such modes as rotation about its molecular axis cannot be observed a diatomic molecule has one normal mode of vibration the normal modes of vibration of molecules are independent of each other but each normal mode will involve simultaneous vibrations of different parts of the molecule such as different chemical bonds a molecular vibration is excited when the molecule a quantum of energy e corresponding to the vibration s frequency according to the relation e where h is planck s constant a fundamental vibration is excited when one such quantum of energy is absorbed by the molecule in its ground state when two are absorbed the first overtone is excited and so on to higher overtones to a first approximation the motion in a normal vibration can be described as a kind of simple harmonic motion in this approximation the vibrational energy is a quadratic function with respect to the atomic and the first overtone has twice the frequency of the fundamental in reality vibrations are anharmonic and the first overtone has a frequency that is slightly lower than twice that of the fundamental excitation of the higher overtones involves less and less additional energy and eventually leads to dissociation of the molecule as the potential energy of the molecule is more like a morse potential the vibrational states of a molecule can be probed in a variety of ways the most direct way is through infrared spectroscopy as vibrational transitions typically require an amount of energy that corresponds to the infrared region of the spectrum raman spectroscopy which typically uses light can also be used to measure vibration frequencies directly the two techniques are complementary and comparison between the two can provide useful structural information such as in the case of the rule of mutual exclusion for molecules vibrational excitation can occur in conjunction with electronic excitation transition giving vibrational fine structure to electronic transitions particularly with molecules in the gas state simultaneous excitation of a vibration and gives rise to vibration rotation spectra vibrational coordinates the coordinate of a normal vibration is a combination of changes in the positions of atoms in the molecule when the vibration is excited the coordinate changes with a frequency the frequency of the vibration internal coordinates internal coordinates are of the following types with reference to the molecule in a rocking wagging or twisting coordinate the bond lengths within the groups involved do not change the angles do rocking is distinguished from wagging by the fact that the atoms in the group in the same plane in ethene there are internal coordinates c h stretching c c stretching h c h rocking wagging twisting note that the h c c angles cannot be used as internal coordinates as the angles at each carbon atom cannot all increase at the same time vibrations of a group in a molecule for illustration these do not represent the recoil of the c atoms which though necessarily present to balance the overall movements of the molecule are much smaller than the movements of the h atoms symmetry adapted coordinates symmetry adapted coordinates may be created by applying a projection operator to a set of internal coordinates the projection operator is constructed with the aid of the table of the molecular point group for example the four c h stretching coordinates of the molecule ethene are given by where are the internal coordinates for stretching of each of the four c h bonds of symmetry adapted coordinates for most small molecules can be found in normal coordinates the normal coordinates denoted as q refer to the positions of atoms away from their equilibrium positions with respect to a normal mode of vibration each normal mode is a single normal coordinate and so the normal coordinate refers to the progress along that normal mode at any given time formally normal modes are determined by solving a and then the normal coordinates over the normal modes can be expressed as a over the cartesian over the atom positions the advantage of working in normal modes is that they the matrix governing the molecular vibrations so each normal mode is an independent molecular vibration associated with its own spectrum of quantum mechanical states if the molecule symmetries it will belong to a point group and the normal modes will transform as an irreducible representation under that group the normal modes can then be determined by applying group theory and the irreducible representation onto the cartesian coordinates for example when this treatment is applied to it is found that the c o are not independent but rather there is a o c o symmetric stretch and an o c o stretch when two or more normal coordinates belong to the same irreducible representation of the molecular point group have the same symmetry there is mixing and the coefficients of the combination cannot be determined a for example in the linear molecule hydrogen the two stretching vibrations are the coefficients a and b are found by performing a full normal coordinate analysis by means of the gf method newtonian mechanics perhaps molecular vibrations can be treated using newtonian mechanics to calculate the correct vibration frequencies the basic is that each vibration can be treated as though it corresponds to a spring in the harmonic approximation the spring s law the force required to the spring is proportional to the extension the proportionality constant is known as a force constant k the anharmonic oscillator is considered elsewhere by second law of motion this force is also equal to a reduced mass times acceleration since this is one and the same force the ordinary differential equation follows the solution to this equation of simple harmonic motion is a is the maximum amplitude of the vibration coordinate q it remains to the reduced mass in general the reduced mass of a diatomic molecule is expressed in terms of the atomic masses and as the use of the reduced mass ensures that the centre of mass of the molecule is not affected by the vibration in the harmonic approximation the potential energy of the molecule is a quadratic function of the normal coordinate it follows that the force constant is equal to the second derivative of the potential energy when two or more normal vibrations have the same symmetry a full normal coordinate analysis must be performed see gf method the vibration frequencies i are obtained from the eigenvalues i of the matrix product gf g is a matrix of numbers derived from the masses of the atoms and the geometry of the molecule f is a matrix derived from force constant values details concerning the determination of the eigenvalues can be found in quantum mechanics in the harmonic approximation the potential energy is a quadratic function of the normal coordinates solving the wave equation the energy states for each normal coordinate are given by where n is a quantum number that can take values of the difference in energy when n changes by are therefore equal to the energy derived using classical mechanics see quantum harmonic oscillator for graphs of the first wave functions the wave functions certain selection rules can be formulated for example for a harmonic oscillator transitions are allowed only when the quantum number n changes by one but this does not apply to an anharmonic oscillator the observation of overtones is only possible because vibrations are anharmonic another consequence of is that transitions such as between states n and n have slightly less energy than transitions between the ground state and first excited state such a transition gives rise to a band intensities in an infrared spectrum the intensity of an absorption band is proportional to the derivative of the molecular dipole moment with respect to the normal coordinate the intensity of raman bands depends on polarizability,Science,13
Fuel_mass_fraction Chemical_physics Science,in combustion physics fuel mass fraction is the ratio of fuel mass flow to the total mass flow of a fuel if an air flow is fuel free the fuel mass fraction is zero in fuel without gases the ratio is unity as fuel is in a combustion process the fuel mass fraction is reduced,Science,14
Electrostatic_deflection_(structural_element) Chemical_physics Science,in molecular physics nanotechnology electrostatic deflection is the deformation of a beam like structure element bent by an electric field fig it can be due to interaction between electrostatic fields and net charge or electric polarization effects the beam like structure element is generally cantilevered at one of its ends in carbon nanotubes cnts are typical ones for electrostatic as show in fig when a material is brought into an electric field e the field tends to shift the positive charge in red and the negative charge in blue in opposite directions thus induced are created fig shows a beam like structure element in an electric field the interaction between the molecular dipole moment and the electric field results an induced torque t then this torque tends to align the beam toward the direction of field in case of a cantilevered cnt fig it would be bent to the field direction meanwhile the electrically induced torque and of the cnt against each other this deformation has been observed in experiments science and apl this property is an important characteristic for cnts promising nanoelectromechanical systems applications as well as for their separation and recently several nanoelectromechanical systems based on cantilevered cnts have been reported such as apl apl apl and feedback device apl which are designed for memory sensing or uses furthermore theoretical studies have been carried out to to get a full understanding of the electric deflection of carbon nanotubes z et al,Science,15
Magic_angle_(EELS) Chemical_physics Science,the magic angle is a particular value of the collection angle of an electron microscope at which the measured energy loss spectrum becomes independent of the angle of the sample with respect to the beam direction the magic angle is not not uniquely defined for isotropic samples but the definition is unique in the typical case of small angle scattering on materials with a c axis such as the magic angle depends on both the incoming electron energy which is typically fixed and on the energy loss by the electron the ratio of the magic angle formula to the characteristic angle formula is roughly independent of the energy loss and more interestingly is roughly independent of the particular type of sample considered mathematical definition for the case of a relativistic incident electron the magic angle is defined by the of two different functions formula and math,Science,16
Reactive_empirical_bond_order Chemical_physics Science,the reactive empirical bond order rebo model is a widely used function for calculating the potential energy of bonds and the force in this model the total potential energy of system is a sum of nearest neighbour pair interactions which depend not only on the distance between atoms but also on their local atomic environment a bond order function was used to describe chemical pair interactions the early formulation and of rebo for carbon systems was done by tersoff in based on works of the tersoff s model could describe single double and triple bond energies in carbon structures such as in and a significant step was taken by brenner in he extended tersoff s potential function to radical and bonds by two additional terms into the bond order function compared to classical first principle and empirical approaches the rebo model is less time since only the and nearest neighbour interactions were considered this advantage of computational efficiency is especially for large scale atomic simulations from to atoms in recent years the rebo model has been widely used in the studies concerning mechanical and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes despite numerous successful applications of the first generation rebo potential function its several drawbacks have been reported e g its form is too to simultaneously fit equilibrium distances energies and force constants for all types of c c bonds the possibility of modeling processes involving atomic collisions is limited because both morse type terms go to finite values when the atomic distance decreases and the neglect of a separate pi bond leads to problems with the of radicals and a poor treatment of to these drawbacks an extension of brenner s potential was proposed by et al it is called the adaptive reactive bond order airebo potential in which both the and attractive pair interaction functions in rebo function are modified to fit bond properties and the long range atomic interactions and single bond interactions are included the airebo model has been used in recent studies using numerical simulations,Science,17
Photofragment-ion_imaging Chemical_physics Science,photofragment ion imaging or more generally product imaging is an experimental technique for making measurements of the velocity of product molecules or particles following a chemical reaction or the photodissociation of a molecule the method uses a two dimensional detector usually a microchannel plate to record the arrival positions of state selected ions created by enhanced multi photon rempi the first experiment using photofragment ion imaging was performed by david w and in on the dynamics of methyl iodide background many problems in molecular reaction dynamics demand the simultaneous measurement of a particle s speed and angular direction the most demanding require the measurement of this velocity in coincidence with internal energy studies of molecular reactions energy transfer processes and photodissociation can only be understood completely if the internal energies and velocities of all products can be specified product imaging approaches this goal by determining the three dimensional velocity distribution of one state selected product of the reaction for a reaction producing two products because the speed of the sibling product is related to that of the measured product through conservation of momentum and energy the internal state of the sibling can often be example a simple example illustrates the principle ozone dissociates following ultraviolet excitation to yield an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule although there are at least two possible channels the principle products are o and that is both the atom and the molecule are in their first excited electronic state see atomic term symbol and molecular term symbol for further explanation at a wavelength of the photon has enough energy to ozone to these two products to excite the to a maximum level of v and to provide some energy to the recoil velocity between the two fragments of course the more energy that is used to excite the vibrations the less will be available for the recoil rempi of the o atom in conjunction with the product imaging technique provides an image that can be used to determine the o three dimensional velocity distribution a slice through this cylindrically symmetric distribution is shown in the figure where an o atom that has zero velocity in the center of mass frame would arrive at the center of the figure note that there are four rings corresponding to four main groups of o speeds these correspond to production of the in the vibrational levels v and the ring corresponding to v is the outer one since production of the in this level the most energy for recoil between the o and thus the product imaging technique immediately shows the vibrational distribution of the note that the angular distribution of the o is not uniform more of the atoms toward the north or south pole than to the in this case the north south axis is parallel to the polarization direction of the light that the ozone ozone molecules that the polarized light are those in a particular alignment distribution with a line the end oxygen atoms in roughly parallel to the polarization because the ozone dissociates more rapidly than it rotates the o and products recoil along this polarization axis but there is more detail as well a close examination shows that the peak in the angular distribution is not actually exactly at the north or south pole but rather at an angle of about degrees this has to do with the polarization of the laser that the o and can be analyzed to show that the angular momentum of this atom which has units is aligned relative to the velocity of recoil more detail can be found elsewhere there are other dissociation channels available to ozone following excitation at this wavelength one produces o and that both the atom and molecule are in their ground electronic state the image above has no information on this channel since only the o is probed however by the ionization laser to the rempi wavelength of o one a completely different image that provides information about the internal energy distribution of the product imaging technique the original product imaging paper the positions of the ions are onto a two dimensional detector a photolysis laser dissociates methyl iodide while an ionization laser is used rempi to ionize a particular vibrational level of the product both lasers are and the ionization laser is at a delay short enough that the products have not moved because of an electron by the ionization laser does not change the recoil velocity of the fragment its position at any time following the photolysis is nearly the same as it would have been as a neutral the advantage of it to an ion is that by repelling it with a set of represented by the vertical solid lines in the figure one can project it onto a two dimensional detector the detector is a double microchannel plate of two glass with closely open channels several in diameter a high is placed across the plates as an ion hits inside a channel it secondary electrons that are then accelerated into the of the channel since multiple electrons are for each one that hits the wall the channels act as individual particle multipliers at the far end of the plates approximately electrons the channel for each ion that entered importantly they exit from a spot right behind where the ion entered the electrons are then accelerated to a phosphor screen and the spots of light are recorded with a charge coupled device ccd camera the image collected from each pulse of the lasers is then sent to a computer and the results of many thousands of laser are to provide an image such as the one for ozone shown previously in this position sensing version of product imaging the position of the ions as they hit the detector is recorded one can the ions produced by the dissociation and ionization lasers as expanding from the center of mass with a particular distribution of velocities it is this three dimensional object that we to detect since the ions created should be of the same mass they will all be accelerated toward the detector it takes very little time for the whole three dimensional object to be into the detector so the position of an ion on the detector relative to the center position is given simply by v where v is its velocity and is the time between when the ions were made and when they hit the detector the image is thus a two dimensional projection of the desired three dimensional velocity distribution for systems with an axis of cylindrical symmetry parallel to the surface of the detector the three dimensional distribution may be recovered from the two dimensional projection by the use of the inverse transform the cylindrical axis is the axis containing the polarization direction of the light it is important to note that the image is taken in the center of mass frame no transformation other than from time to speed is needed a final advantage of the technique should also be mentioned ions of different masses arrive at the detector at different times this differential arises because each ion is accelerated to the same total energy e as it the electric field but the acceleration speed vz varies as e thus vz varies as the reciprocal of the square root of the ion mass or the arrival time is proportional to the square root of the ion mass in a perfect experiment the ionization laser would ionize only the products of the dissociation and those only in a particular internal energy state but the ionization laser and perhaps the photolysis laser can create ions from other material such as or other the ability to detect a single mass by the detector is thus an important advantage in reducing noise to the product imaging technique velocity map imaging a major improvement to the product imaging technique was achieved by eppink and parker a difficulty that limits the resolution in the position sensing version is that the spot on the detector is no smaller than the cross sectional area of the ions excited for example if the volume of interaction of the molecular beam photolysis laser and ionization laser is say x x then the spot for an ion moving with a single velocity would still span x at the detector this is much larger than the limit of a channel width and is compared to the radius of a typical detector without some further improvement the velocity resolution for a position sensing apparatus would be limited to about one part in five eppink and parker found a way around this limit their version of the product imaging technique is called velocity map imaging velocity map imaging is based on the use of an lens to accelerate the ions toward the detector when the are properly adjusted this lens has the advantage that it focuses ions with the same velocity to a single spot on the detector regardless where the ion was created this technique thus overcomes the caused by the finite overlap of the laser and molecular beams three dimensional ion imaging and replaced the phosphor screen by a time delay line anode in order to be able to measure all three components of the initial product momentum vector simultaneously for each individual product particle at the detector this technique allows one to measure the three dimensional product momentum vector distribution without having to rely on mathematical reconstruction methods which require the investigated systems to be cylindrically symmetric later velocity mapping was added to imaging techniques have been used to characterize several elementary photodissociation processes and bimolecular chemical reactions chang et al realized that further increase in resolution could be gained if one carefully analyzed the results of each spot detected by the ccd camera under the microchannel plate typical in most laboratories each such spot was in diameter by a to each of up to spots per laser shot to determine the center of the distribution of each spot chang et al were able to further increase the velocity resolution to the equivalent of one pixel out of the pixel radius of the ccd slice imaging need to add this electron imaging product imaging of positive ions by rempi detection is only one of the areas where charged particle imaging has useful another area was in the detection of electrons the first ideas along these lines seem to have an early history et al were perhaps the first to a microscope they realized that trajectories of an electron emitted from an atom in different directions may again at a large distance from the atom and create an interference pattern they proposed building an apparatus to observe the predicted rings et al eventually realized such a and used it to study the of it was helm and co workers however who were the first to create an electron imaging apparatus the instrument is an improvement on previous photoelectron spectrometers in that it provides information on all energies and all angles of the for each shot of the laser helm and his co workers have now used this technique to investigate the ionization of and in more recent examples hayden and have pioneered the use of excitation and ionization to follow excited state dynamics in larger molecules coincidence imaging need to add a section here on work by hayden and others examples perhaps let people list examples of use here we need a good example of a bimolecular reaction or energy transfer another thought is to make a table here of the groups using this technique a reference the type of variation being used the type of application

Newton's_laws_of_motion Experimental_physics Science,image laws in latin thumb right newton s first and second laws in latin from the original principia mathematica law thumb walter explains newton s first law and reference frames mit physics physics i classical mechanics fall video mit course the three laws of motion were first compiled by sir isaac newton in his work naturalis principia mathematica first published in newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems for example in the third volume of the newton showed that these laws of motion combined with his law of universal gravitation explained kepler s laws of motion overview newton s laws are applied to bodies objects which are considered or idealized as a particle in the sense that the extent of the body is neglected in the evaluation of its motion i e the object is small compared to the distances involved in the analysis or the deformation and rotation of the body is of no importance in the analysis therefore a planet can be idealized as a particle for analysis of its motion around a in their original form newton s laws of motion are not to characterize the motion of rigid bodies and deformable bodies euler in introduced a generalization of newton s laws of motion for rigid bodies called the euler s laws of motion later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a continuum if a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles each governed by laws of motion then laws can be derived from laws laws can however be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies independently of any particle structure newton s laws hold only with respect to a certain set of frames of reference called newtonian or inertial reference frames some authors the first law as defining what an inertial reference frame is from this point of view the second law only holds when the observation is made from an inertial reference frame and therefore the first law cannot be as a special case of the second other authors do treat the first law as a of the second the explicit concept of an inertial frame of reference was not developed until long after newton s death in the given interpretation mass acceleration momentum and most importantly force are assumed to be defined quantities this is the most common but not the only interpretation one can consider the laws to be a definition of these quantities newtonian mechanics has been by special relativity but it is still useful as an approximation when the speeds involved are much than the speed of light newton s first law newton s laws are valid only in an inertial reference frame any reference frame that is in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame i e galilean invariance or the principle of newtonian relativity newton s first law is a of the law of inertia which galileo had already described and newton gave credit to galileo had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe that heavy objects like wanted to be at rest on the earth and that light objects like wanted to be at rest in the and the stars wanted to remain in the he thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest and for the body to in a straight line at a constant speed an external was needed to it otherwise it would stop moving galileo however realized that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body i e acceleration but no force is needed to maintain its velocity this insight leads to newton s first force means no acceleration and hence the body will maintain its velocity the law of inertia apparently occurred to several different natural and scientists independently including thomas in his the century also formulated the law although he did not perform any experiments to confirm it newton s second law where since the law is valid only for constant mass systems the mass can be taken outside the differentiation operator by the constant factor rule in differentiation thus where f is the net force applied m is the mass of the body and a is the body s acceleration thus the net force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration in other words if a body is accelerating then there is a force on it any mass that is gained or by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force a different equation is necessary for variable mass systems see below consistent with the first law the time derivative of the momentum is non zero when the momentum changes direction even if there is no change in its magnitude such is the case with uniform circular motion the relationship also implies the conservation of momentum when the net force on the body is zero the momentum of the body is constant any net force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum newton s second law requires modification if the effects of special relativity are to be taken into account because at high speeds the approximation that momentum is the product of rest mass and velocity is not accurate impulse an impulse j occurs when a force f acts over an interval of time t and it is given by since force is the time derivative of momentum it follows that this relation between impulse and momentum is to newton s wording of the second law impulse is a concept frequently used in the analysis of collisions and impacts variable mass systems variable mass systems like a rocket fuel and spent gases are not closed and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law where is the total external force on the system m is the total mass of the system and acm is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system where u is the relative velocity of the or incoming mass with respect to the center of mass of the body under some the quantity m d t on the left hand side known as the is defined as a force the force on the body by the changing mass such as rocket and is included in the quantity f then by the definition of acceleration the equation becomes history the sense or senses in which newton used his and how he understood the second law and intended it to be understood have been extensively discussed by of science along with the relations between newton s formulation and modern newton s third law in the above as motion is newton s name for momentum hence his distinction between motion and velocity the third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies and thus that there is no such as a force or a force that acts on only one body whenever a first body exerts a force f on a second body the second body exerts a force on the first body f and are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction this law is sometimes referred to as the action reaction law with f called the action and the reaction the action and the reaction are simultaneous as shown in the diagram opposite the forces on each other are equal in magnitude but act in opposite directions although the forces are equal the are not the less massive will have a greater acceleration due to newton s second law the two forces in newton s third law are of the same type e g if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car s tires then it is also a frictional force that newton s third law predicts for the tires backward on the road put very simply a force acts between a pair of objects and not on a single object so each and every force has two ends each of the two ends is the same except for being opposite in direction the ends of a force are mirror images of each other one might say from a mathematical point of view newton s third law is a one dimensional vector equation which can be stated as follows given two objects a and b each a force on the other where newton used the third law to derive the law of conservation of momentum however from a conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea derived via s from galilean invariance and holds in cases where newton s third law appears to for instance when force fields as well as particles momentum and in quantum mechanics importance and range of validity newton s laws were verified by experiment and observation for over years and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life newton s laws of motion together with his law of universal gravitation and the mathematical techniques of provided for the first time a quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena these three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions however newton s laws combined with universal gravitation and classical electrodynamics are for use in certain most notably at very small scales very high speeds in special relativity the lorentz factor must be included in the expression for momentum along with rest mass and velocity or very strong gravitational fields therefore the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a optical properties of errors in non systems and superconductivity explanation of these phenomena requires more physical theories including general relativity and quantum field theory in quantum mechanics concepts such as force momentum and position are defined by linear operators that operate on the quantum state at speeds that are much lower than the speed of light newton s laws are just as exact for these operators as they are for classical objects at speeds comparable to the speed of light the second law holds in the original form which says that the force is the derivative of the momentum of the object with respect to time but some of the newer versions of the second law such as the constant mass approximation above do not hold at relativistic velocities relationship to the conservation laws in modern physics the laws of conservation of momentum energy and angular momentum are of more general validity than newton s laws since they apply to both light and matter and to both classical and non classical physics this can be stated simply momentum energy and angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed because force is the time derivative of momentum the concept of force is redundant and to the conservation of momentum and is not used in fundamental theories e g quantum mechanics quantum electrodynamics general relativity etc the standard model explains in detail how the three fundamental forces known as gauge forces out of exchange by virtual particles other forces such as gravity and fermionic pressure also arise from the momentum conservation indeed the conservation of momentum in inertial motion via space time results in what we call gravitational force in general relativity theory application of space derivative which is a momentum operator in quantum mechanics to overlapping wave functions of pair of fermions particles with half integer spin results in shifts of of compound away from each other which is observable as of fermions newton stated the third law within a world view that assumed instantaneous action at a distance between material particles however he was for philosophical criticism of this action at a distance and it was in this context that he stated the famous i no hypotheses in modern physics action at a distance has been completely eliminated except for effects involving quantum however in modern engineering in all practical applications involving the motion of vehicles and the concept of action at a distance is used extensively conservation of energy was discovered nearly two centuries after newton s the long delay occurring because of the difficulty in understanding the role of microscopic and forms of energy such as heat and red light,Science,25
Uncertainty Experimental_physics Science,uncertainty is a term used in different ways in a number of fields including physics philosophy statistics insurance psychology engineering and information science it applies to predictions of future events to physical measurements already made or to the unknown concepts uncertainty for example if you do not know whether it will rain tomorrow then you have a state of uncertainty if you apply probabilities to the possible outcomes using or even just a probability assessment you have quantified the uncertainty suppose you quantify uncertainty as a chance of if you are planning a major costly event for tomorrow then you have risk since there is a chance of rain and rain would be furthermore if this is a business event and you would lose if it then you have quantified the risk a chance of losing these situations can be made even more realistic by light rain vs heavy rain the cost of vs etc some may represent the risk in this example as the expected opportunity loss eol or the chance of the loss multiplied by the amount of the loss that is useful if the of the event is risk neutral which most people are not most would be willing to pay a to avoid the loss an insurance company for example would compute an eol as a minimum for any insurance coverage then add on to that other operating costs and profit since many people are willing to insurance for many reasons then clearly the eol is not the value of avoiding the risk quantitative uses of the terms uncertainty and risk are consistent from fields such as probability theory science and information theory some also create new terms without changing the definitions of uncertainty or risk for example is a variation on uncertainty sometimes used in information theory but outside of the more mathematical uses of the term usage may vary widely in cognitive psychology uncertainty can be real or just a matter of such as expectations etc or ambiguity are sometimes described as second order uncertainty where there is uncertainty even about the definitions of uncertain states or outcomes the difference here is that this uncertainty is about the human definitions and concepts not an objective fact of nature it has been that ambiguity however is avoidable while uncertainty of the first order kind is not necessarily avoidable uncertainty may be purely a consequence of a lack of knowledge of obtainable facts that is you may be uncertain about whether a new rocket design will work but this uncertainty can be removed with further analysis and experimentation at the level however uncertainty may be a fundamental and property of the universe in quantum mechanics the heisenberg uncertainty principle limits on how much an can ever know about the position and velocity of a particle this may not just be ignorance of obtainable facts but that there is no fact to be found there is some in physics as to whether such uncertainty is an irreducible property of nature or if there are hidden variables that would describe the state of a particle even more exactly than heisenberg s uncertainty principle allows measurements the middle notation is used when the error is not about the value for example formula this can occur when using a scale for example the latter notation is used for example by in the atomic mass of elements there the uncertainty given in applies to the least significant figure s of the number prior to the value i e from to left for instance stands for while stands for often the uncertainty of a measurement is found by the measurement enough times to get a good estimate of the standard deviation of the values then any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation however if the values are then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty equal to the standard error of the mean which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements when the uncertainty represents the standard error of the measurement then about of the time the true value of the measured quantity within the stated uncertainty range for example it is likely that for of the atomic mass values given on the list of elements by atomic mass the true value outside of the stated range if the width of the interval is doubled then probably only of the true values lie outside the doubled interval and if the width is tripled probably only lie outside these values follow from the properties of the normal distribution and they apply only if the measurement process produces normally distributed errors in that case the standard errors are easily to one sigma two sigma or three sigma in this context uncertainty depends on both the accuracy and precision of the measurement instrument the lower the accuracy and precision of an instrument the larger the measurement uncertainty is notice that precision is often determined as the standard deviation of the repeated measures of a given value using the same method described above to assess measurement uncertainty however this method is correct only when the instrument is accurate when it is inaccurate the uncertainty is larger than the standard deviation of the repeated measures and it appears evident that the uncertainty does not depend only on instrumental precision uncertainty and the media uncertainty in science and science in general is often interpreted much differently in the public sphere than in the scientific community this is due in part to the diversity of the public audience and the tendency for scientists to and therefore not communicate ideas clearly and effectively one example is explained by the information model also in the public there are often many scientific giving on a single topic for example depending on how an issue is reported in the public sphere between outcomes of multiple scientific studies due to differences could be interpreted by the public as a lack of consensus in a situation where a consensus does in fact exist this interpretation may even been as scientific uncertainty may be to reach certain goals for example global warming took the of to frame global warming as an issue of scientific uncertainty which was a precursor to the frame used by journalists when reporting the issue can be loosely said to apply to situations in which not all the parameters of the system and their interactions are fully known whereas ignorance refers to situations in which it is not known what is not known these indeterminacy and ignorance that exist in science are often into uncertainty when reported to the public in order to make issues more since scientific indeterminacy and ignorance are difficult concepts for scientists to without losing conversely uncertainty is often interpreted by the public as ignorance the transformation of indeterminacy and ignorance into uncertainty may be related to the of uncertainty as ignorance journalists often either inflate uncertainty making the science seem more uncertain than it really is or downplay uncertainty making the science seem more certain than it really is one way that journalists inflate uncertainty is by describing new research that past research without providing context for the change other times journalists give scientists with views equal weight as scientists with majority views without describing or explaining the state of scientific consensus on the issue in the same journalists often give non scientists the same amount of attention and importance as scientists journalists may downplay uncertainty by carefully chosen wording and by losing these the information is and presented as more certain and than it really also stories with a single source or without any context of previous research mean that the subject at hand is presented as more definitive and certain than it is in reality there is often a over approach to science that too in the of finally and most notably for this investigation when science is framed by journalists as a uncertainty is framed as and some media routines and organizational factors affect the of uncertainty other media routines and organizational factors help inflate the of an issue because the general public in the united states generally scientists when science stories are covered without from special interest organizations groups environmental organization etc they are often covered in a business related sense in an economic development frame or a social progress frame the nature of these frames is to downplay or uncertainty so when economic and scientific are focused on early in the issue cycle as has happened with coverage of plant biotechnology and nanotechnology in the united states the matter in question seems more definitive and certain sometimes too or will pressure a media organization to promote the business aspects of a scientific issue and therefore any uncertainty that may the business are or eliminated applications in financial such as the market,Science,26
Ripple_tank Experimental_physics Science,in physics and engineering a ripple tank is a shallow glass tank of water used in and to demonstrate the basic properties of waves it is a specialized form of a wave tank the ripple tank is usually illuminated from above so that the light through the water some small ripple fit onto the top of an overhead i e they are illuminated from below the ripples on the water show up as on the screen underneath the tank all the basic properties of waves including reflection refraction interference and diffraction can be demonstrated ripples may be generated by a piece of wood that is suspended above the tank on elastic bands so that it is just the surface to wood is a motor that has an off centre weight attached to the axle as the axle rotates the motor the wood and generating ripples demonstrating wave properties a number of wave properties can be demonstrated with a ripple tank these include plane waves reflection refraction interference and diffraction circular waves when the rippler is attached with a point ball and lowered so that it just touches the surface of the water circular waves will seen to be produced plane waves when the rippler is lowered so that it just touches the surface of the water plane waves will seen to be produced in the illustration the brown is the rippler reflection demonstrating reflection and focusing of by a metal bar in the tank and the bar a pulse of three of four ripples can be sent towards the metal bar the ripples reflect from the bar if the bar is placed at an angle to the wavefront the reflected waves can be seen to the law of reflection the angle of incidence and angle of reflection will be the same if a obstacle is used a plane wave pulse will on a point after reflection this point is the focal point of the mirror circular waves can be produced by a single drop of water into the ripple tank if this is done at the focal point of the mirror plane waves will be reflected back refraction if a of glass is placed in the tank the depth of water in the tank will be over the glass than elsewhere the speed of a wave in water depends on the depth so the ripples slow down as they pass over the glass this causes the wavelength to decrease if the between the and shallow water is at an angle to the wavefront the waves will refract in the diagram above the waves can be seen to towards the normal the normal is shown as a line the line is the direction that the waves would travel if they had not met the piece of glass in practice showing refraction with a ripple tank is quite to do diffraction if a small obstacle is placed in the path of the ripples and a slow frequency is used there is no shadow area as the ripples refract around it as shown below on the left a faster frequency may result in a shadow as shown below on the right if a large obstacle is placed in the tank a shadow area will probably be observed if an obstacle with a small gap is placed in the tank the ripples emerge in an almost pattern if the gap is large however the diffraction is much more limited small in this context means that the size of the obstacle is comparable to the wavelength of the ripples see also s principle diffraction from a grid a phenomenon identical to the x ray diffraction of x rays from an atomic crystal lattice can also be seen thus demonstrating the principles of crystallography if one a grid of obstacles into the water with the spacing between the obstacles roughly corresponding to the wavelength of the water waves one will see diffraction from the grid at certain angles between the grid and the waves the waves will appear to reflect off the grid at other angles the waves will pass through similarly if the frequency wavelength of the waves is altered the waves will also pass through or be reflected depending on the precise relationship between spacing orientation and wavelength interference interference can be produced by the use of two that are attached to the main ripple bar in the below on the left the light areas represent of waves the black areas represent notice the grey areas they are areas of destructive interference where the waves from the two sources one another out to the right is a of two point interference generated in a circular ripple tank,Science,27
Particle-induced_X-ray_emission Experimental_physics Science,particle induced x ray emission or proton induced x ray emission pixe is a technique used in the determining of the elemental make up of a material or sample when a material is to an ion beam atomic interactions occur that give off radiation of in the x ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum specific to an element pixe is a powerful yet non destructive elemental analysis technique now used routinely by and others to help questions of and the technique was first proposed in by johansson of lund university sweden and developed over the next few years with his and thomas b johansson recent of pixe using tightly focused beams down to gives the additional capability of microscopic analysis this technique called micropixe can be used to determine the distribution of trace elements in a wide range of samples a related technique particle induced ray emission can be used to detect some light elements theory x ray emission quantum theory states that electrons of an atom must occupy discrete energy levels in order to be stable with ions of sufficient energy usually mev protons produced by an ion accelerator will cause inner shell ionization of atoms in a outer shell electrons drop down to inner shell however only certain transitions are allowed x rays of a characteristic energy of the element are emitted an energy detector is used to record and measure these x rays only elements than can be detected the lower detection limit for a pixe beam is given by the ability of the x rays to pass through the between the chamber and the x ray detector the upper limit is given by the ionisation cross section the probability of the k electron shell ionisation this is maximal when the velocity of the proton the velocity of the electron of the speed of light therefore mev proton beams are optimal proton backscattering protons can also interact with the nucleus of the atoms in the sample through elastic collisions backscattering often repelling the proton at angles close to degrees the give information on the sample thickness and composition the bulk sample properties allow for the correction of x ray photon loss within the sample proton transmission the transmission of protons through a sample can also be used to get information about the sample protein analysis protein analysis using micropixe allow for the determination of the elemental composition of liquid and crystalline proteins micropixe can quantify the metal content of protein molecules with a relative accuracy of between and the advantage of micropixe is that given a protein of known sequence the x ray emission from sulfur can be used as an internal standard to calculate the number of metal atom per protein because only relative concentrations are calculated there are only minimal systematic errors and the results are totally consistent the relative concentrations of dna to protein and metals can also be measured using the groups of the bases as an internal data analysis analysis of the data collected can be performed by the programs the end to limitations in order to get a meaningful sulfur signal from the analysis the buffer should not contain sulfur i e no or compounds excessive amounts of in the buffer should also be this will overlap with the sulfur peak and are suitable advantages there are many advantages to using a proton beam over an electron beam there is less crystal from radiation although there is some from the emission of electrons there is significantly less than if the primary beam was itself an electron beam because of the higher mass of protons relative to electrons there is less lateral deflection of the beam this is important for proton beam writing applications scanning two dimensional maps of elemental can be generated by scanning the micropixe beam across the target cell and tissue analysis whole cell and tissue analysis is possible using a micropixe beam this method is also referred to as nuclear artifact analysis micropixe is a useful technique for the non destructive analysis of and although it provides only an elemental analysis it can be used to and measure layers within the thickness of an artifact proton beam writing proton beams can be used for writing proton beam writing through either the of a by proton induced cross or through the of a proton sensitive material this may have important effects in the field of nanotechnology,Science,28
Experimental_physics Experimental_physics Science,within the field of physics experimental physics is the category of disciplines and sub disciplines concerned with the observation of physical phenomena in order to data about the universe methods vary from discipline to discipline from simple experiments and observations such as the experiment to more complicated ones such as the large collider overview experimental physics all the disciplines of physics that are concerned with data acquisition data acquisition methods and the detailed beyond simple thought experiments and of laboratory experiments it is often put in contrast with theoretical physics which is more concerned with predicting and explaining the physical behaviour of nature than the acquisition of knowledge about it although experimental and theoretical physics are concerned with different aspects of nature they both share the same goal of understanding it and have a relation the former provides data about the universe which can then be analyzed in order to be understood while the latter provides for the data and thus offers insight on how to better data and on how to set up experiments theoretical physics can also offer insight on what data is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the universe and on what experiments to in order to obtain it history as a distinct field experimental physics was established in early modern europe during what is known as the scientific revolution by physicists such as galileo huygens johannes kepler and sir isaac newton in the early century galileo made extensive use of experimentation to physical theories which is the key idea in the modern scientific method galileo formulated and successfully tested several results in dynamics in particular the law of inertia which later became the first law in newton s laws of motion in galileo s two new sciences a between the and discuss the motion of a ship as a moving frame and how that ship s is to its motion huygens used the motion of a along a dutch to an early form of the conservation of momentum experimental physics is considered to have with the publication of the naturalis principia mathematica in by sir isaac newton in newton published the principia two comprehensive and successful physical theories newton s laws of motion from which arise classical mechanics and newton s law of universal gravitation which describes the fundamental force of gravity both theories well with experiment the principia also included several theories in fluid dynamics from the late century thermodynamics was developed by physicist and boyle young and many others in used statistical with classical mechanics to derive thermodynamic results the field of statistical mechanics in demonstrated the of mechanical work into heat and in stated the law of conservation of energy in the form of heat as well as mechanical energy boltzmann in the nineteenth century is responsible for the modern form of statistical mechanics classical mechanics and thermodynamics another great field of experimental within physics was the nature of electricity observations in the and century by scientists such as boyle and created a foundation for later work these observations also established our basic understanding of electrical charge and current by had discovered that atoms of different elements have different and proposed the modern theory of the atom it was hans who first proposed the between electricity and magnetism after observing the deflection of a by a nearby electric current by the early michael faraday had demonstrated that magnetic fields and electricity could generate each other in james maxwell presented to the society a set of equations that described this relationship between electricity and magnetism maxwell s equations also predicted correctly that light is an electromagnetic wave starting with astronomy the principles of natural philosophy into fundamental laws of physics which were and improved in the centuries by the century the sciences had into multiple fields with specialized researchers and the field of physics although pre no longer could claim of the entire field of scientific research method experimental physics uses two main methods of experimental research controlled experiments and natural experiments controlled experiments are often used in laboratories as laboratories can offer a controlled environment natural experiments are used for example in astrophysics when observing objects where control of the variables in effect is impossible experimental techniques some well known experimental techniques include timelines see the timelines below for of physics experiments,Science,29
Complementary_experiments Experimental_physics Science,in physics two experimental techniques are often called complementary if they investigate the same subject in two different ways such that two different ideally non overlapping properties or aspects can be investigated for example x ray scattering and neutron scattering experiments are often said to be complementary because the former information about the electron density of the atoms in the target but gives no information about the nuclei because they are too small to affect the x rays significantly while the latter allows you to investigate the nuclei of the atoms but cannot you about their electron because the neutrons being neutral do not interact with the charged electrons scattering experiments are sometimes also called complementary when they investigate the same physical property of a system from two complementary view points in the sense of for example time resolved and energy resolved experiments are said to be complementary the former uses a pulse which is well defined in time its position is well known at a given time the latter uses a pulse well defined in energy its frequency is well known,Science,30
Elevator_paradox_(physics) Experimental_physics Science,the elevator paradox to a hydrometer placed on an elevator or vertical that by moving to different changes the pressure in this classic demonstration the hydrometer remains at an equilibrium position essentially a hydrometer measures specific gravity of liquids independent of barometric pressure this is because the change in air pressure is applied to the entire hydrometer flask the portion of the flask receives a force through the liquid thus no portion of the apparatus receives a net force resulting from a change in air pressure this is a paradox if the buoyancy of the hydrometer is said to depend on the weight of the liquid that it displaces at a higher barometric pressure the liquid occupies a slightly smaller volume and thus more dense might be considered to have a higher specific gravity however the hydrometer also displaces air and the weight of the liquid and the air are affected equally by cartesian a cartesian diver on the other hand has an internal space that unlike a hydrometer is not rigid and thus can change its as increasing external air pressure the air in the diver if the diver instead of being placed in the classic were in a flask on an elevator the diver would to a change in air pressure similarly a non rigid like a will be affected as will the cage of a human diver and such systems will vary in buoyancy a glass hydrometer is rigid under normal pressure for all practical purposes the hydrometer in an accelerating frame of reference the or downward acceleration of the elevator as long as the net force is directed downward will not change the equilibrium point of the hydrometer either the force due to acceleration acts on the hydrometer exactly as it would on an equal mass of water or other liquid,Science,31
Wave_tank Experimental_physics Science,a wave tank is a laboratory for observing the behavior of surface waves the typical wave tank is a box filled with liquid usually water leaving open or air filled space on top at one end of the tank an generates waves the other end usually has a wave surface a similar device is the ripple tank which is flat and shallow and used for observing patterns of surface waves from above a wave is a wave tank which has a width and length of comparable magnitude often used for testing structures and three dimensional models of and their another type of wave tank is the wave which is in width and often has windows for observing the wave motion as well as the physical model being tested in literature in the novel state of fear a wave tank was to simulate a made,Science,32
Philosophical_interpretation_of_classical_physics Experimental_physics Science,classical newtonian physics has formally been replaced by quantum mechanics on the small scale and relativity on the large scale because most humans continue to think in terms of the kind of events we in the human scale of daily life it became necessary to provide a new philosophical interpretation of classical physics classical mechanics worked extremely well within its domain of observation but made inaccurate predictions at very small scale atomic scale systems and when objects moved very fast or were very massive through the lens of quantum mechanics or relativity we can now see that classical physics from the world of our everyday experience includes for which there is no actual evidence for example one commonly held idea is that there exists one absolute time shared by all another is the idea that electrons are discrete entities like that circle the nucleus in definite orbits the correspondence principle says that classical accounts are approximations to quantum mechanics that are for all practical purposes equivalent to quantum mechanics when with macro scale events various problems occur if classical mechanics is used to describe quantum systems such as the ultraviolet in black body radiation the paradox and the lack of a zero point for entropy since classical physics corresponds more closely to ordinary language than modern physics does this subject is also a part of the philosophical interpretation of ordinary language which has other aspects as well the measurement process in classical mechanics it is assumed that given properties speed or mass of a particle temperature of a gas etc can in principle be measured to any degree of accuracy desired study of the problem of measurement in quantum mechanics has shown that measurement of any object involves interactions between the measuring apparatus and that object that affect it in some way at the scale of particles this effect is necessarily large on the everyday macroscopic scale the effect can be made small furthermore the classical of a property simply being measured the fact that measurement of a property temperature of a gas by say involves a pre existing account of the behavior of the measuring device when effort was to working out the operational definitions involved in precisely determining position and momentum of scale entities physicists were required to provide such an account for measuring to be used at that scale the key thought experiment in this regard is known as heisenberg s microscope the problem for the individual is how to properly characterize a part of reality of which one has no direct sense experience our into the quantum domain find most it is that happens in between the events by means of which we obtain our only information our accounts of the quantum domain are based on interactions of macro domain instruments and sense with physical events and those interactions give us some but not all of the information we seek we then seek to derive further information from series of those experiments in an way we can say that physics is a part of science and as such aims at a description and understanding of nature any kind of understanding scientific or not depends on our language on the communication of ideas every description of phenomena of experiments and their results upon language as the only means of communication the words of this language represent the concepts of daily life which in the scientific language of physics may be refined to the concepts of classical physics these concepts are the only tools for an unambiguous communication about events about the setting up of experiments and about their results if therefore the atomic physicist is asked to give a description of what really happens in his experiments the words description and really and happens can only refer to the concepts of daily life or of classical physics as soon as the physicist gave up this basis he would lose the means of unambiguous communication and could not continue in his science therefore any statement about what has actually happened is a statement in terms of the classical concepts and because of thermodynamics and of the uncertainty relations by its very nature incomplete with respect to the details of the atomic events involved the demand to describe what happens in the quantum theoretical process between two successive observations is a in since the describe refers to the use of the classical concepts while these concepts cannot be applied in the space between the observations they can only be applied at the points of observation primacy of observation in quantum mechanics and special relativity both quantum mechanics and special relativity begin their divergence from classical mechanics by on the primacy of observations and a to entities thus special relativity the absolute assumed by classical mechanics and quantum mechanics does not one to of properties of the system exact position say other than those that can be connected to macro scale observations position and momentum are not waiting for us to rather they are the results that are obtained by performing certain,Science,33
X-ray_crystal_truncation_rod Experimental_physics Science,x ray crystal truncation rod scattering is a powerful method in surface science based on analysis of surface x ray diffraction patterns from a crystalline surface for an crystal the diffracted pattern is in delta function like bragg peaks presence of crystalline surfaces results in additional structure along so called truncation rods linear regions in momentum space normal to the surface crystal truncation rod ctr measurements allow detailed determination of atomic structure at the surface especially useful in cases of oxidation growth and adsorption studies on crystalline surfaces theory a particle incident on a crystalline surface with momentum formula will undergo scattering through a momentum change of formula if formula and formula represent directions in the plane of the surface and formula is perpendicular to the surface then the scattered intensity as a function of all possible values of formula is given by i mathbf q frac sin left tfrac n xa x right sin left tfrac q xa x right frac sin left tfrac n ya y right sin left tfrac q ya y right frac alpha z alpha n z cos left n zc right alpha alpha cos left q zc right math where formula is the defined as the ratio of x ray amplitudes scattered from successive planes of atoms in the crystal and formula formula and formula are the lattice in the x y and z directions respectively in the case of perfect adsorption formula and the intensity becomes independent of formula with a maximum for any formula the component of formula parallel to the crystal surface that satisfies the condition in reciprocal space mathbf q parallel mathbf g h mathbf a x k mathbf a y math for formula and formula this condition results in rods of intensity in reciprocal space oriented perpendicular to the surface and passing through the reciprocal lattice points of the surface as in fig these rods are known as diffraction rods or crystal truncation rods when formula is allowed to vary from the intensity along the rods varies according to fig note that in the limit as formula approaches unity the x rays are fully and the scattered intensity approaches a periodic delta function as in bulk diffraction this calculation has been done according to the single scattering approximation this has been shown to be accurate to within a factor of formula of the peak intensity dynamical multiple scattering to the model can result in even more accurate predictions of ctr intensity to obtain high quality data in x ray ctr measurements it is that the detected intensity be on the order of at least formula to achieve this level of output the x ray source must typically be a synchrotron source more traditional sources such as rotating anode sources provide orders of magnitude less x ray flux and are only suitable for studying high atomic number materials which return a higher diffracted intensity the maximum diffracted intensity is roughly proportional to the square of the atomic number formula anode x ray sources have been successfully used to study formula for example when doing x ray measurements of a surface the sample is held in ultra high vacuum and the x rays pass into and out of the chamber through windows there are approaches to chamber and diffractometer design that are in use in the first method the sample is fixed relative to the vacuum chamber which is kept as small and light as possible and mounted on the diffractometer in the second method the sample is rotated within the chamber by coupled to the outside this approach avoids a large mechanical on the diffractometer making it easier to maintain fine angular resolution one of many is that the sample must be moved in order to use other surface analysis methods such as or and after moving the sample back into the x ray diffraction position it must be in some the sample chamber can be from the diffractometer without breaking vacuum allowing for other users to have access for examples of x ray ctr diffractometer apparatus see in ctr for a given incidence angle of x rays onto a surface only the of the crystal truncation rods with the ewald sphere can be observed to measure the intensity along a ctr the sample must be rotated in the x ray beam so that the origin of the ewald sphere is and the sphere the rod at a different location in reciprocal space performing a in this way requires accurate motion of the sample and the detector along different axes to achieve this motion the sample and detector are mounted in an apparatus called a four circle diffractometer the sample is rotated in the plane the incoming and diffracted beam and the detector is moved into the position necessary to the diffracted ctr intensity surface structures surface features in a material produce variations in the ctr intensity which can be measured and used to evaluate what surface structures may be present two examples of this are shown in fig in the case of a at an angle formula a second set of rods is produced in reciprocal space called superlattice rods from the regular lattice rods by the same angle formula the x ray intensity is strongest in the region of between the lattice rods grey and superlattice rods black lines in the case of ordered steps the ctr intensity is into segments as shown in real materials the of surface features will be so regular but these two examples show the way in which surface and are in the obtained diffraction patterns,Science,34
Faraday_cup_electrometer Experimental_physics Science,the faraday cup electrometer is the simplest form of an electrical aerosol instrument used in aerosol studies it consists of an electrometer and a filter inside a faraday cage charged particles collected by the filter generate an electric current which is measured by the electrometer principle according to law the charge collected on the faraday cup is the induced charge that means that the filter does not need to be a it is typically used to measure particles of charge which are particles with a net charge concentration that the charge concentration of or negatively charged particles with an aerosol electrometer the transportation of charge by electrical charged aerosol particles can be measured as electric current in a metal faraday cup a particle filter is mounted on an a faraday cup is a detector that measures the current in a beam of charged aerosol particles faraday are used e g in mass spectrometers being an alternative to secondary electron multipliers the advantage of the faraday cup is its and the possibility to measure the ion or electron stream furthermore the is constant by time and not mass dependent the form is the following a faraday detector consists of a metal cup that is placed in the path of the particle beam the aerosol has to pass the filter inside the cup the filter has to be isolated it is connected to the electrometer circuit which measures the current,Science,35
Line_source Experimental_physics Science,a line source is a source of air noise water or electromagnetic radiation that from a linear one dimensional geometry the most prominent linear sources are roadway air pollution air emissions roadway noise certain types of water pollution sources that over a range of river extent rather than from a discrete point elongated light tubes certain models in medical physics and electromagnetic while point sources of pollution were studied since the late nineteenth century linear sources did not receive much attention from scientists until the late when environmental for highways and began to emerge at the same time computers with the processing power to accommodate the data processing of the computer models required to tackle these one dimensional sources became more available in addition this era of the saw the first of environmental scientists who the disciplines required to these studies for example and computer scientists in the air pollution field were required to build complex models to address roadway air modeling prior to the these to work within their own disciplines but with the advent of the air act the noise control act in the usa and other seminal the era of multidisciplinary environmental science had for electromagnetic linear sources the early advances in computer modeling arose in the and usa when the end of world war ii and the war were partially by progress in electronic including the technologies of active arrays linear air pollution source air pollution levels near major highways and urban are in violation of u s national air quality standards where millions of or work even the interior of a building does not really protect from adverse exterior air quality since the exterior air is the supply and it is well known that air quality is typically than exterior air a roadway by motor vehicles can be idealized by a line source emitting air pollutants this mathematical problem was first solved in by a collaboration of physics mathematics and computer science the original theory assumed state traffic conditions and meteorology on a straight roadway currently the models have to treat variable meteorology time variant traffic operations and complex geometries current technology allows highway and city planners to analyze alternative roadway development plans and assess air quality impacts the same basic model theory can be applied to operations since the linear source is an line in the early these esl models were refined into area source models to account for the finite width of the roadway linear noise source roadway noise is the most important example of a linear noise source since it about of the environmental noise for humans worldwide in the when computer modeling of this phenomenon was the first applications of linear source noise modeling became systematic after of the national environmental policy act and noise control act the demand for detailed analysis and makers began to to scientists for the planning of new roadways and the design of noise mitigation the intensity of roadway noise is governed by the following variables traffic operations speed age of roadway surface type types roadway and the geometry of area structures due to the complexity of the variables a line source acoustic model must be a computer model that can analyze sound levels in the vicinity of roadways the first meaningful models arose in the late and early two of the leading research teams were in boston and esl of california both of these groups developed complex mathematical models to allow the study of roadway designs traffic operations and noise mitigation strategies in an arbitrary setting later model alterations have come into use among state of transportation and city planners but the accuracy of early models has had little change in years generally line source acoustic models trace sound ray and calculate loss along with ray divergence or from phenomena diffraction is usually addressed by secondary at any points of or such as noise or building surfaces meteorology can be addressed in a statistical manner allowing for actual wind and wind speed statistics along with data water pollution line source less common are line source applications in the field of water pollutant this phenomenon generally arises when surface runoff soil from upper soil layers and these pollutants to a linear water such as a river the underlying land management which lead to such sources of water pollution are application construction and activity and urban runoff again computer models are needed to address the complexity of such an extended linear into a dynamic medium such as water the resulting surface runoff water pollutants may be considered a line source into a river or stream the chemical composition of this surface runoff may be by a surface runoff model such as the runoff algorithm while the may be analyzed by a dynamic river pollutant model such as light emission line source in the study of illumination a variety of sources are linear in nature most commonly the fluorescent tube during the process of interior design it is important to calculate the light intensity at work or other user areas not only to sufficient light is present but more importantly to avoid over illumination and its energy as well as adverse health effects thus the scientists involved in light transmission calculations employ computer models that linear sources when fluorescent are used in a typical setting there may be hundreds of finite length light sources that comprise the light output in an office environment a related concept are the ultraviolet tubes used in where output radiation from the tube can be accurately modeled by treating the tube as a line source on a larger scale an illuminated roadway may act as a line source of light pollution,Science,36
X-ray_standing_waves Experimental_physics Science,the x ray standing wave technique the x ray standing wave xsw technique can be used to study the structure of surfaces and interfaces with high spatial resolution and chemical pioneered by b w in the the availability of synchrotron light has stimulated the application of this technique to a wide range of problems in surface science basic principles an x ray interference field created by bragg reflection provides the length scale against which atomic distances can be measured the spatial modulation of this field described by the dynamical theory of x ray diffraction a change when the sample is through the bragg condition due to a relative phase variation between the incoming and the reflected beam the planes of the xsw field shift by half a lattice constant depending on the position of the atoms within this wave field the element specific absorption of x rays varies in a characteristic way therefore measurement of the photo yield via x ray or photoelectron spectroscopy can reveal the position of the atoms relative to the lattice planes for a quantitative analysis the photo yield formula is described by y p r r f h cos pi p h math where formula is the and formula is the relative phase of the interfering beams the characteristic shape of formula can be used to derive precise structural information about the surface atoms because the two parameters formula coherent fraction and formula coherent position are directly related to the fourier representation of the atomic distribution function since the emitting atoms are located in the near field this technique does not from the phase problem of x ray crystallography therefore and with a sufficiently large number of fourier components being measured xsw data can be used to the distribution of the different atoms in the unit cell xsw imaging selected applications which require ultra high vacuum conditions which do not require ultra high vacuum conditions,Science,37
Point_source Experimental_physics Science,a point source is a single localized source of something a point source has negligible extent it from other source geometries sources are called point sources because in mathematical modeling these sources can usually be approximated as a mathematical point to analysis the actual source need not be physically small if its size is negligible relative to other length scales in the problem for example in astronomy stars are routinely treated as point sources even though they are in much larger than the earth in three the density of something leaving a point source decreases in to the inverse square of the distance from the source if the distribution is in all directions and there is no absorption or other loss mathematics in mathematics a point source is a from which flux or flow is although such as this do not exist in the observable universe mathematical point sources are often used as approximations to reality in physics and other fields light generally a source of light can be considered a point source if the resolution of the imaging instrument is too low to its size or if the object is at a very great distance formula where formula is the wavelength of light and formula is the diameter radio waves radio wave sources which are smaller than one radio wavelength are also generally treated as point sources radio emissions generated by a fixed electrical circuit are usually polarized producing anisotropic radiation if the propagating medium is however the power in the radio waves at a given distance will still vary as the inverse square of the distance if the angle remains constant to the source polarization sound sound is an oscillating pressure wave as the pressure up and down an point source acts in turn as a fluid point source and then a fluid point sink such an object does not exist physically but is often a good simplified model for calculations heat in vacuum heat as radiation if the source remains stationary in a fluid such as air flow patterns can form around the source due to leading to an anisotropic pattern of heat loss the most common form of anisotropy is the formation of a thermal plume above the heat source fluid fluid point sources are commonly used in fluid dynamics and a point source of fluid is the inverse of a fluid point sink a point where fluid is removed whereas fluid exhibit complex rapidly changing behaviour such as is seen in vortices for example water running into a plug or generated at points where air is fluid sources generally produce simple flow patterns with stationary isotropic point sources generating an expanding sphere of new fluid if the fluid is moving such as wind in air or currents in water a plume is generated from the point source pollution sources of various types of pollution are often considered as point sources in large scale studies of pollution,Science,38
Einstein–de_Haas_effect Experimental_physics Science,the haas effect or the richardson effect after owen richardson is a physical phenomenon by albert einstein and wander johannes de haas in the mid s that a relationship between magnetism angular momentum and the spin of elementary particles wander johannes de haas rowan de haas was also a major to the theory applying its principles to the engineering industry specifically rowan s contributions had a effect on the industry in the early century description the effect corresponds to the mechanical rotation that is induced in a ferromagnetic material of cylindrical shape and originally at rest suspended with the aid of a thin inside a coil on driving an impulse of electric current through the coil to this mechanical rotation of the ferromagnetic material say iron is associated a mechanical angular momentum which by the law of conservation of angular momentum must be by an equally large and directed angular momentum inside the ferromagnetic material given the fact that an external magnetic field here generated by driving electric current through the coil leads to magnetisation of electron spins in the material or to reversal of electron spins in an already provided that the direction of the applied electric current is chosen the haas effect demonstrates that spin angular momentum is indeed of the same nature as the angular momentum of rotating bodies as in classical mechanics this is remarkable since electron spin being quantized cannot be described within the framework of classical mechanics einstein w j de haas proof of s molecular currents s hypothesis that magnetism is caused by the microscopic circular of electric the authors proposed a design to test lorentz s theory that the rotating particles are electrons the aim of the experiment was to measure the torque generated by a reversal of the magnetisation of an iron einstein w j de haas experimental proof of the of s molecular currents in einstein wrote three papers with wander j de haas on experimental work they did together on s molecular currents known as the haas effect he immediately wrote a correction to paper above when dutch physicist h a lorentz out an error in addition to the two papers above is and einstein and de haas a on paper later in the year for the same journal this topic was only indirectly related to einstein s interest in physics but as he wrote to his in old age i am developing a for experimentation calculations based on a model of electron spin as a electric charge this magnetic moment by a factor of approximately the g factor a correct description of this magnetic moment requires a treatment based on quantum electrodynamics,Science,39

Dynamic_mode_decomposition Experimental_physics Science,physical systems such as fluid flow or mechanical vibrations behave in characteristic patterns known as modes in a flow for example one may think of a of vortices a big main vortex driving smaller secondary ones and so on most of the motion of such a system can be described using only a few of those patterns in a purely mathematical setting similar modes can be extracted form the governing equations using an eigenvalue decomposition but in many cases the mathematical model is very complicated or not available at all in an experiment the mathematical description is not at hand and one has to rely on the measured data only the dynamic mode decomposition dmd is a mathematical method to extract the relevant modes from experimental data without any to the governing equations it can thus be applied to any dynamic phenomenon where appropriate data is available it is similar but different from decomposition which has similar features but dynamical information about the data description a time physical situation may be approximated by the action of a linear operator formula to the instantaneous state vector the dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the evolution operator formula from a known sequence of observations formula the matrix s is small as compared to the sample data v therefore eigenvalues and can be computed with examples trailing edge of a profile the of an obstacle in the flow may develop a vortex the fig shows the shedding of a vortex behind the trailing edge of a profile the dmd analysis was applied to sequential entropy fields and yield an approximated eigenvalue spectrum as depicted below the analysis was applied to the numerical results without referring to the governing equations the profile is seen in white the white arcs are the processor since the computation was performed on a parallel computer using different computational blocks roughly a third of the spectrum was highly damped large negative formula and is not shown the shedding mode is shown in the following pictures the image to the left is the real part the image to the right the imaginary part of the eigenvector again the entropy eigenvector is shown in this pictures the acoustic of the same mode is seen in the half of the next the top half corresponds to the entropy mode as above example of a pattern the dmd analysis assumes a pattern of the form formula where formula is any of the independent variables of the problem but has to be selected in take for example the pattern with the time as the factor a sample is given in the following figure with formula formula and formula the left picture shows the pattern without the right with noise added the amplitude of the random noise is the same as that of the pattern a dmd analysis is performed with generated fields using a time interval formula limiting the analysis to formula the spectrum is symmetric and shows almost modes small negative real part whereas the other modes are heavily damped their numerical values are formula respectively the real one corresponds to the mean of the field whereas formula corresponds to the imposed pattern with formula a relative error of increasing the noise to times the signal value yields about the same error the real and imaginary part of one of the latter two is depicted in the following figure see also several other of experimental data exist if the governing equations are available an eigenvalue decomposition might be feasible,Science,42
Euler's_laws_of_motion Experimental_physics Science,euler s laws of motion formulated by euler about years after isaac newton formulated his laws about the motion of particles them to rigid body motion overview euler s first law euler s first law states that the linear momentum of a body formula is equal to the product of the mass of the body and the velocity of its center of mass formula internal forces between the particles that make up a body do not contribute to changing the total momentum of the body the law is also stated as formula euler s second law euler s second law states that the rate of change of angular momentum about a point formula is equal to the sum of the external moments about that point formula for rigid bodies translating and rotating in only this can be expressed as formula where is the position vector of the center of mass with respect to the point about which moments are explanation and derivation the density of internal forces at every point in a deformable body are not necessarily equal i e there is a distribution of throughout the body this variation of internal forces throughout the body is governed by newton s second law of motion of conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum which normally are applied to a mass particle but are extended in continuum mechanics to a body of continuously distributed mass for continuous bodies these laws are called laws of motion if a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles each governed by laws of motion then equations can be derived from laws equations can however be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies independently of any particle structure the total body force applied to a continuous body with mass formula and volume formula is expressed as where formula is the body force density body forces and contact forces acting on the body lead to corresponding moments of force torques relative to a given point thus the total applied torque formula about the origin is given by where formula and formula indicate moments caused by body and contact forces respectively thus the sum of all applied forces and torques with respect to the origin of the coordinate system in the body can be given by let the coordinate system formula be an inertial frame of reference let formula be the position vector of a particle or point formula in the continuous body with respect to the origin of the coordinate system and formula the velocity vector of point formula first axiom or law law of balance of linear momentum or balance of forces states that in an inertial frame the time rate of change of linear momentum formula of an arbitrary portion of a continuous body is equal to the total applied force formula acting on the considered portion and it is expressed as second axiom or law law of balance of angular momentum or balance of torques states that in an inertial frame the time rate of change of angular momentum formula of an arbitrary portion of a continuous body is equal to the total applied torque formula acting on the considered portion and it is expressed as the derivatives of formula and formula are material derivatives,Science,43
Holometer Experimental_physics Science,the fermilab holometer in is currently under construction and will be the world s most sensitive laser when complete the sensitivity of the and systems and theoretically able to detect holographic fluctuations in the holometer may be capable of meeting or the sensitivity required to detect the smallest units in the universe called planck units fermilab states is these days with the and images or sound transmission associated with poor internet bandwidth the holometer seeks to detect the equivalent or noise in reality itself associated with the frequency limit imposed by nature a particle at fermilab states about the experiment what for is when the lasers lose step with each other to detect the smallest unit in the universe this is really great a of old physics experiment where you know what the result will be experimental physicist of the max planck institute in germany states that although he is that the apparatus will successfully detect the holographic fluctuations if the experiment is successful it would be a very strong to one of the most open questions in fundamental physics it would be the first proof that space time the of the universe is quantized the hypothesis that holographic noise may be observed in this manner has been on the grounds that the theoretical framework used to derive the noise lorentz invariance lorentz invariance violation is however very already an issue that has been very addressed in the mathematical treatment,Science,44
Quantum_oscillations_(experimental_technique) Experimental_physics Science,in condensed matter physics quantum oscillations describes an experimental technique to map the fermi surface of a metal in the presence of a strong magnetic field the technique is based on the principle of landau of fermions moving in a magnetic field for a gas of free fermions in a strong magnetic field the energy levels are quantized into bands called the landau levels whose separation is inversely proportional to the strength of the magnetic field in a quantum oscillations experiment the external magnetic field is varied which causes the landau levels to pass over the fermi surface which in turn results in oscillations of the hall resistance observation of quantum oscillations in a material is considered a signature of fermi liquid behaviour quantum oscillations have been used to study high temperature superconducting materials such as cuprates and studies using these experiments have showed that the ground state of underdoped cuprates behave similar to a fermi liquid and display characteristics such as landau quasiparticles experiment when a magnetic field is applied to a system of free fermions their energy states are quantized into the so called landau levels given by formula for integer formula where formula is the external magnetic field and formula are the charge and effective mass respectively when the external magnetic field formula is increased in an isolated system the landau levels expand and eventually fall off the fermi surface this leads to oscillations in the observed energy of the highest occupied level and hence in the hall the of these oscillations can be measured and in turn can be used to determine the cross sectional area of the fermi surface if the axis of the magnetic field is varied at constant magnitude similar oscillations are observed the oscillations occur whenever the landau orbits the fermi surface in this way the complete geometry of the fermi sphere can be underdoped cuprates studies of under compounds such as through probes such as arpes have that these show characteristics of non fermi liquids and in particular the absence of well defined landau quasiparticles however quantum oscillations have been observed in these materials at low if their superconductivity is by a sufficiently high magnetic field which is evidence for the presence of well defined quasiparticles with fermionic statistics these experimental results thus with those from arpes and other probes,Science,45
Bioinformatics Experimental_physics Science,bioinformatics is the application of computer science and information technology to the field of biology and medicine bioinformatics with algorithms databases and information systems web technologies artificial intelligence and soft computing information and computation theory software engineering data mining image processing modeling and simulation signal processing discrete mathematics control and system theory circuit theory and statistics bioinformatics generates new knowledge as well as the computational tools to create that knowledge commonly used software tools and technologies in this field include java perl c c python r cuda and microsoft introduction bioinformatics was applied in the creation and maintenance of a database to biological information at the beginning of the genomic revolution such as nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences development of this type of database involved not only design issues but the development of complex interfaces researchers could access existing data as well as new or data the primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes what sets it apart from other approaches however is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal examples include pattern recognition data mining machine learning algorithms and visualization major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment gene finding genome assembly drug design drug discovery protein structure alignment protein structure prediction prediction of gene expression and interactions genome wide association studies and the modeling of evolution interestingly the term bioinformatics was coined before the genomic revolution and introduced the term in to refer to the study of information processes in systems this definition placed bioinformatics as a field parallel to biophysics or biochemistry biochemistry is the study of chemical processes in biological systems however its primary use since at least the late has been to describe the application of computer science and information sciences to the analysis of biological data particularly in those areas of genomics involving large scale dna sequencing bioinformatics now the creation and of databases algorithms computational and statistical techniques and theory to solve and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data over the past few decades rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a amount of information related to molecular biology bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to understanding of biological processes common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing dna and protein sequences aligning different dna and protein sequences to compare them and creating and d models of protein structures there are two fundamental ways of a biological system e g living cell both under bioinformatic approaches a broad sub category under bioinformatics is structural bioinformatics major research areas sequence analysis since the was sequenced in the dna sequences of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases this sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode proteins rna genes regulatory sequences structural motifs and repetitive sequences a comparison of genes within a species or between different species can show between protein functions or relations between species the use of molecular to construct with the growing amount of data it long ago became impractical to analyze dna sequences manually today computer programs such as are used daily to search sequences from more than organisms containing over nucleotides these programs can compensate for mutations or inserted bases in the dna sequence to identify sequences that are related but not identical a variant of this sequence alignment is used in the sequencing process itself the so called shotgun sequencing technique which was used for example by the institute for genomic research to sequence the first bacterial genome haemophilus influenzae does not produce entire chromosomes instead it generates the sequences of many thousands of small dna fragments ranging from to nucleotides long depending on the sequencing technology the ends of these fragments overlap and when aligned properly by a genome assembly program can be used to reconstruct the complete genome shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes for a genome as large as the human genome it may take many days of cpu time on large memory computers to assemble the fragments and the resulting assembly will usually contain numerous that have to be filled in later shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research another of bioinformatics in sequence analysis is annotation this involves computational gene finding to search for protein coding genes rna genes and other functional sequences within a genome not all of the nucleotides within a genome are part of genes within the genomes of higher organisms large parts of the dna do not serve any obvious purpose this so called dna may however contain functional elements bioinformatics to the gap between genome and projects for example in the use of dna sequences for protein identification genome annotation in the context of genomics annotation is the process of the genes and other biological features in a dna sequence the first genome annotation software system was designed in by dr owen white who was part of the team at the institute for genomic research that sequenced and analyzed the first genome of a free living organism to be decoded the haemophilus influenzae dr white built a software system to find the genes places in the dna sequence that encode a protein the transfer rna and other features and to make initial of function to those genes most current genome annotation systems work similarly but the programs available for analysis of genomic dna are changing and computational evolutionary biology future work to reconstruct the now more complex of life the area of research within computer science that uses genetic algorithms is sometimes confused with computational evolutionary biology but the two areas are not necessarily related literature analysis the area of research from statistics and computational analysis of gene expression the expression of many genes can be determined by measuring mrna levels with multiple techniques including microarrays expressed cdna sequence tag sequencing serial analysis of gene expression tag sequencing parallel signature sequencing rna seq also known as whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing or various applications of in hybridization all of these techniques are extremely noise and or subject to in the biological measurement and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate signal from noise in high throughput gene expression studies such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder one might compare microarray data from cancerous cells to data from non cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up regulated and down regulated in a particular population of cancer cells analysis of regulation regulation is the complex of events starting with an signal such as a and leading to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more proteins bioinformatics techniques have been applied to various steps in this process for example analysis involves the identification and study of sequence motifs in the dna the coding region of a gene these motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mrna expression data can be used to infer gene regulation one might compare microarray data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state in a single cell organism one might compare stages of the cell cycle along with various conditions heat shock etc one can then apply clustering algorithms to that expression data to determine which genes are co expressed for example the regions of co expressed genes can be for over represented regulatory elements analysis of protein expression protein microarrays and high throughput ht mass ms can provide a of the proteins present in a biological sample bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and ht ms data the former approach similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mrna the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected analysis of mutations in cancer in cancer the genomes of affected cells are in complex or even ways massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized systems to manage the volume of sequence data produced and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genome sequences and new physical detection technologies are employed such as oligonucleotide microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses called comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide arrays to detect known point mutations these detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome and when used in high throughput to measure thousands of samples generate terabytes of data per experiment again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians the data is often found to contain considerable or noise and thus hidden markov model and change point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of found to be recurrent among many tumors comparative genomics the core of comparative genome analysis is the of the correspondence between genes analysis or other genomic features in different organisms it is these maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes a of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution at the level point mutations affect individual nucleotides at a higher level large chromosomal segments undergo lateral transfer and whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization and often leading to rapid the complexity of genome evolution many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms who have to a spectra of statistical and mathematical techniques ranging from exact heuristics fixed parameter and approximation algorithms for problems based on models to markov chain algorithms for bayesian analysis of problems based on models many of these studies are based on the homology detection and protein families computation modeling biological systems systems biology involves the use of computer simulations of cellular subsystems such as the networks of and enzymes which comprise metabolism signal pathways and gene regulatory networks to both analyze and the complex of these cellular processes artificial life or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple artificial life forms structural bioinformatic approaches prediction of protein structure protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics the amino acid sequence of a protein the so called primary structure can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that for it in the vast majority of cases this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment of course there are such as the a k a disease knowledge of this structure is in understanding the function of the protein for lack of better terms structural information is usually classified as one of secondary tertiary and structure a viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem as of now most efforts have been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time one of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the of homology in the genomic branch of bioinformatics homology is used to predict the function of a gene if the sequence of gene a whose function is known is homologous to the sequence of gene b whose function is unknown one could infer that b may share a s function in the structural branch of bioinformatics homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins in a technique called homology modeling this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known this currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably one example of this is the similar protein homology between hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in both serve the same purpose of oxygen in the organism though both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences their protein structures are virtually identical which reflects their near identical purposes other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein and de novo from physics based modeling see also structural and structural domain molecular interaction efficient software is available today for studying interactions among proteins ligands and peptides types of interactions most often in the field include including drug and molecular dynamic simulation of of atoms about bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational algorithms docking algorithms for studying molecular interactions see also interaction prediction docking algorithms in the last two decades tens of thousands of protein three dimensional structures have been determined by x ray crystallography and protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy protein nmr one central question for the biological scientist is whether it is practical to predict possible interactions only based on these without doing interaction experiments a variety of methods have been developed to tackle the docking problem though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field software and tools software tools for bioinformatics range from simple line tools to more complex graphical programs and standalone web services available from various bioinformatics companies or public institutions open source bioinformatics software many free and open source software tools have and continued to grow since the the combination of a continued need for new algorithms for the analysis of emerging types of biological the potential for innovative in silico experiments and freely available open code bases have helped to create opportunities for all research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics and the range of open source software available regardless of their funding the open source tools often act as of ideas or community supported plug in commercial applications they may also provide de standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of integration the range of open source software packages includes such as taverna workbench and in order to maintain this and create further opportunities the non profit open bioinformatics foundation have supported the annual bioinformatics open source conference since web services in bioinformatics and rest based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world the main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance basic bioinformatics services are classified by the into three sequence search services multiple sequence alignment and biological sequence analysis the availability of these service oriented bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web based bioinformatics solutions and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data under a single standalone or web based interface to distributed and bioinformatics workflow management systems bioinformatics workflow management systems a bioinformatics workflow management system is a specialized form of a workflow management system designed specifically to and a series of computational or data steps or a workflow in a bioinformatics application such systems are designed to currently there are two platforms giving this service and taverna,Science,46
Computational_biology Experimental_physics Science,computational biology involves the development and application of data analytical and theoretical methods mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological behavioral and social systems the field is defined and includes foundations in computer science applied mathematics statistics biochemistry chemistry biophysics molecular biology genetics evolution neuroscience and visualization computational biomodeling computational biomodeling a field concerned with building computer models of biological systems computational genomics computational genomics a field within genomics which studies the genomes of cells and organisms high throughput genome sequencing produces of data which requires extensive processing sequence assembly and uses dna microarray technologies to perform statistical on the genes expressed in individual cell types this can help find genes of interest for certain diseases or conditions this field also studies the mathematical foundations of sequencing advances in many areas of genomics research are heavily rooted in engineering technology from the units used in large scale dna sequencing projects computational neuroscience computational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the system computational biology vs bioinformatics bioinformatics and computational biology are rooted in life sciences as well as computer and information sciences and technologies both of these approaches from specific disciplines such as mathematics physics statistics computer science and engineering biology and behavioral science bioinformatics and computational biology each maintain close interactions with life sciences to their full potential bioinformatics involves information theory and data management applying principles of information sciences and technologies to make the vast diverse and complex life sciences data more and useful computational biology on the other hand uses mathematical and computational approaches to directly address biological hypotheses both theoretical and experimental in nature although bioinformatics and computational biology are distinct there is also significant overlap and activity at their interface and they are consequently often confused by those outside of the discipline another way to the difference is that bioinformaticians build software while computational biologists use and the software to tackle their specific biological questions,Science,47
Folding@home Experimental_physics Science,folding home or f h is a distributed computing project for simulation of protein folding computational drug design and other molecular dynamics for disease research it primarily attempts to determine how proteins reach their final three dimensional structure which is of significant academic interest and has major implications for research into alzheimer s disease huntington s disease and many forms of cancer among other diseases to a certain extent folding home also tries to predict that final structure and to determine how other molecules may interact with it which has applications in drug design folding home is developed and operated by the pande laboratory at stanford university under the leadership of pande and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world in a collaboration known as the folding home folding home is by the processing resources of thousands of personal computers and playstation as part of the project s client server architecture these systems receive simulation work units complete them and return them to database servers where they are compiled into an overall simulation can track their contributions on the folding home website which can make participation and long term the project has pioneered the uses of gpus playstation and message passing interface used for computing on multi core processors for distributed computing and scientific research this large scale computing network has allowed folding home to simulate protein folding at timescales thousands of times longer than previously achieved the project uses simulation methodology that represents a paradigm shift from traditional computational approaches since its launch on october the pande lab has produced six scientific research papers as a direct result of the project folding home at approximately petaflops a higher computational performance than all distributed computing projects under boinc combined and it remains one of the world s fastest computing systems this computing power makes folding home the most powerful molecular dynamics and allows it to run computationally expensive atomic level simulations over biologically relevant timescales these simulations have demonstrated accuracy to observations in laboratory research which is a challenge in computational biology project significance proteins are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within cells they often act as enzymes performing biochemical reactions including cell molecular transportation and cellular regulation as structural elements some proteins act as a type of for cells and as other proteins participate in the immune system before a protein can take on these roles it must fold into a functional three dimensional structure a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its amino acid sequence protein folding is driven by the search to find the most conformation of the protein i e its native state thus understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works and is considered a of computational biology despite folding occurring within a crowded cellular environment it typically proceeds however due to a protein s chemical properties or other factors proteins may that is fold down the and end up cellular mechanisms are capable of or refolding such misfolded proteins they can aggregate and cause a variety of diseases laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail leading scientists to use physics based computational models that when complementing experiments seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding misfolding and aggregation due to the complexity of proteins conformation space and limitations in computational power all atom molecular dynamics simulations have been limited in the timescales which they can study while most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds prior to simulations could only reach to timescales general purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding but such systems are expensive and typically shared between many different research groups and because the in kinetic models are serial in nature strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult additionally as the protein folding process is stochastic a limited number of long simulations are not sufficient for comprehensive views of protein folding protein folding does not occur in a single step instead a significant portion of the folding time is spent waiting in various intermediate conformational states where each state represents a local free energy minimum in the protein s energy landscape folding home simulations from these states and the rates and probabilities of transitions between sets of in parallel this approach protein s phase space while avoiding much of the computation inside the local minimum state itself and achieves near linear parallelization leading to a significant in overall serial calculation time the conformational states and the short simulations between them are then compiled into a statistical markov state model msm which essentially serves as a map of the protein s energy landscape and kinetic and equilibrium thermodynamic properties once constructed each msm illustrates folding events and pathways and can represent its conformational states at an arbitrary resolution it can also reveal which transitions are limiting the model s accuracy which allows for specific follow up simulations to improve the of the model using this adaptive sampling technique the amount of time it takes to construct an accurate markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run i e the number of processors available folding home has used these msms to simulate folding at biologically relevant timescales to reveal how proteins and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments in folding home used markov state models to complete approximately a million cpu days of simulations over the span of several months and in msms another simulation that required an aggregate million cpu of computation in january folding home used msms to simulate the dynamics of the slow folding protein out to milliseconds a timescale that is a thousand times longer than previously achieved the model of many individual trajectories each two orders of magnitude shorter this was the first demonstration that msms were capable of capturing folding events that could not be seen by simulation methods in folding home researcher was awarded the thomas paradigm shift award from the american chemical society for the instrumental development of the software used to automatically build these msms and for quantitative agreement between theory and experiment for his work pande was awarded the michael and award for young investigators for developing field defining and field changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and rna folding as well as the young award for his unique approach to advances in algorithms that make optimal use of distributed computing which places his efforts at the cutting edge of simulations the results have stimulated a examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single molecule measurements making dr efforts contributions to simulation methodology biomedical research protein misfolding is a component in the development of a variety of diseases including alpha alzheimer s disease cancer cell disease huntington s disease osteogenesis imperfecta s disease and type ii once it is understood how a protein misfolds therapeutic intervention can follow which can use molecules to the production of a certain protein to help a misfolded protein or to assist in the folding process cellular infection by viruses such as hiv and influenza also involve folding events within cellular computer assisted drug design has the potential to drug discovery the combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility of the future of molecular medicine and the rational design of even though simulations run on folding home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments researchers can use folding home to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular in folding home continued simulations of folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel to help scientists better understand how natural and might influence the folding process researchers can further use folding home to study aspects of folding misfolding and its relationship to disease that are exceptionally difficult to observe experimentally for example scientists typically employ chemical to proteins from their stable native state it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain structures which may influence folding behavior but folding home has been used to study this denatured state and the mechanism folding home is dedicated to producing significant amounts of results about protein folding and the diseases that result from protein misfolding it is also used to develop novel computational methods for drug design the goal of the first five years of the project was to make significant advances in understanding folding while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease especially alzheimer s disease the pande lab is a non profit organization and does not the results generated by folding home the large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon and some can be from the folding home website the pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the blue gene supercomputer they also share folding home s key software with other researchers so that the algorithms which folding home may aid other scientific areas in they released the open source software which is based on folding home s msm and other parallelization techniques and aims to significantly improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large computer clusters or supercomputers of all of the scientific from folding home are posted on the folding home website after publication the full publications are available online from an academic library alzheimer s disease alzheimer s disease is an incurable form of which most often the its cause remains largely unknown but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease and is associated with toxic of the amyloid beta peptide a fragment of the larger amyloid precursor protein high concentrations of misfolded cause protein oligomer growth that in turn contribute to misfolding this process appears to be toxic and leads to the oligomer aggregates then collect into dense known as a of alzheimer s the of the disease depends not only on the amount of but also on how it misfolds however due to the nature of these aggregates experimental studies of the oligomer structure in atomic detail are difficult and simulations of oligomer aggregates are extremely computationally demanding due to their size and complexity in folding home simulated oligomerization in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of this was significant as previous simulations had been to use simplified models and been limited to several hundreds of microseconds six orders of magnitude short of experimentally relevant timescales this study helped prepare the pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process this is as a promising approach to the development of therapeutic drugs for treating alzheimer s the pande lab is focusing their research on alzheimer s with the goal of predicting the aggregate structure for drug design approaches as well as developing methods to stop the oligomerization process in folding home found several small drug which appear to the of in these drug leads from the test tube to testing on living tissue and in close with the center for protein folding continue to be refined in folding home simulations of several mutations that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug approaches to the disease as well as greatly assisting with experimental nmr spectroscopy studies of the oligomers in the same year folding home began simulations of various fragments in order to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of huntington s disease huntington s disease is a genetic disorder that is also associated with protein misfolding and aggregation excessive repeats of the amino acid at the n of the huntingtin protein cause aggregation and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood it does lead to the cognitive associated with the disease as with other aggregates there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure scientists are using folding home to study huntingtin protein aggregate structure as well as to predict how the aggregate forms assisting with rational drug design approaches to stop the aggregate formation the fragment of the huntingtin protein this aggregation and while there have been several proposed mechanisms its exact role in this process remains largely unknown folding home has simulated this and other fragments in order to their roles in the disease since the pande lab has applied the drug design approaches used in alzheimer s disease to huntington s and in folding home researcher thomas proposed a novel therapeutic strategy for huntington s which may be funded by the national institutes of health this strategy could be used to the results from folding home directly to a therapeutic drug cancer more than half of all known cancers involve mutations of a tumor protein present in every cell which the cell cycle and for cell death in the event of to dna specific mutations in can these functions allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing resulting in the development of tumors these mutations may between the various types and locations of cancer and analysis of these mutations is important for understanding the root causes of related cancers in folding home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of s protein in explicit water which revealed insights that were previously unobtainable and from it produced the first peer reviewed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project the following year they developed a method to identify the amino acids that are crucial for the of a given protein which was then used to study mutations of the method demonstrated success in cancer mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally following these studies the pande lab expanded their efforts to other related diseases folding home is also being used to study protein chaperones which act as heat shock proteins and assist with protein folding inside the crowded and environment and which have essential roles in cell rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones for their function and some chaperones key roles in resistance these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient drugs or for reducing the of cancer using folding home and working closely with the protein folding center the pande lab hopes to find a drug which those chaperones involved in cancerous cells researchers are also using folding home to study other molecules related to cancer such as the enzyme and certain forms of the in folding home began simulations of the dynamics of the small protein which can identify in imaging by binding to surface of cancer cells from simulations of this protein they hope to accelerate research efforts to it to identify other diseases or to bind to drugs il is a protein which plays crucial roles in t cells of the immune system attack and tumors its use as a cancer treatment is due to serious side effects such as pulmonary il to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to t cells so il research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms in folding home assisted with the discovery of a form of il which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but fewer side effects in experiments this altered form significantly outperformed natural il in tumor growth pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the molecule and the national institutes of health is testing it against a large variety of tumor models in the hopes of accelerating its development as a therapeutic osteogenesis imperfecta osteogenesis imperfecta also known as bone disease is a incurable genetic bone disorder which can be those with the disease are unable to make functional bone tissue this is most commonly due to a mutation in type i collagen which is the most abundant protein in and fulfills a variety of structural roles the mutation causes a deformation in collagen s triple structure which if not destroyed leads to abnormal and bone tissue in the pande lab produced a publication on a quantum mechanical technique that improved upon previous simulations methods and which may be useful for future computational studies of collagen although researchers have used folding home to study collagen folding and misfolding the interest stands as a pilot project compared to alzheimer s and huntington s research viruses the pande lab is using folding home to study certain viruses such as influenza and hiv with a focus on preventing the virus from the cell influenza in particular has been responsible for periodic high such as the which may have up to million people worldwide membrane fusion is an essential event for viral infection and involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking a virus may after this process or a virus may itself in the cell s membrane membrane fusion is also crucial to a wide range of biological functions and it has pharmaceutical implications but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown fusion events may involve the interactions of over a half million atoms for hundreds of microseconds this complexity and timescale makes standard computer simulations exceptionally difficult which are typically limited to about thousand atoms over tens of a difference of several orders of magnitude such mechanisms are difficult to analyse experimentally however in scientists applied markov state models and the folding home network to gain detailed insights into the fusion process using folding home for detailed simulations of fusion in the pande lab introduced a new technique for measuring fusion intermediate in researchers used folding home to study mutations of influenza hemagglutinin a protein that a virus to its target cell and assists with viral mutations to hemagglutinin affect the binding to the cell surface of a target species which determines the of the virus to that species knowledge of the effects of hemagglutinin mutations assists in the development of drugs in folding home began simulations of the dynamics of the enzyme rnase h a key component of hiv in the hopes of designing drugs to deactivate it as of folding home to simulate the folding and interactions of hemagglutinin complementing experimental studies at the university of drug design drugs function by binding to specific locations on target molecules and causing a certain desired change such as a pathogen ideally a drug should act very specifically and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions however it is difficult to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind due to limitations in computational power current in silico approaches usually have to speed for accuracy e g use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally expensive free energy calculations folding home allows researchers to use both to evaluate these techniques and to find ways to improve their efficiency an accurate prediction of these binding has the potential to significantly lower the development costs of new drugs folding home has been used to study binding locations on protein surfaces by testing the interactions of different molecules with known binding sites folding home took part in s experiment which assessed current computational protein and ligand modeling methods by having various researchers attempt to predict which of a set of ligands would to a target protein and to estimate their associated binding energies the pande lab has used folding home to study how bacteria develop an to an of last as well as to study the dynamics of beta a protein that plays important roles in drug resistance in the hope of being better able to design drugs to deactivate it approximately half of all known antibiotics with the of a bacteria s ribosome a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating rna into proteins antibiotics the ribosome s exit tunnel preventing of essential bacterial proteins in the pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics in they used folding home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it the full structure of the ribosome has only been recently determined and folding home has also simulated ribosomal proteins as the functions of many of them remain largely unknown ribosomal research has helped the pande lab prepare for larger and more complex biomedical problems participation in addition to reporting active processors folding home also determines its computing performance as measured in flops based on the actual time of its calculations originally this was simply native flops that is the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware in march folding home began reporting the performance in both native and flops the latter being an of how many flops the calculation would take on the standard architecture which is commonly used as a performance reference specialized hardware such as gpus can efficiently perform certain complex functions in a single flop which would otherwise require multiple flops on the architecture this measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences despite using for the gpu and clients flops are much greater than their native flops and comprise a large majority of folding home s flop performance in folding home as the most powerful distributed computing network in the world as of may the project has about active cpus about active gpus and about active for a total of about native petaflops petaflops at the same time the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under boinc petaflops from around active hosts using the markov state model approach folding home achieves strong scaling across its user base and gains a near linear speedup for every additional processor this large and powerful network allows folding home to do work not possible any other way active participation in folding home has since its launch in march google co launched google compute as add on for the google toolbar which allowed windows users to participate in the project although limited in functionality and scope it increased participation in folding home from up to about active cpus the program in october in of the official folding home clients and is no longer available for the toolbar folding home also gained participants from genome home another distributed computing project from the pande lab and a project to folding home the goal of genome home was protein design and associated applications but was officially concluded in march following its completion users were asked to computing power to folding home instead petaflops milestones on september due in large part to the participation of playstation the folding home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaflops becoming the first computing system of any kind in the world to do so on may the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaflops by the three and four native petaflops milestones on and september respectively it was the first computing project to do so then on february folding home achieved a performance level of just above five native petaflops most recently on november folding home crossed the six native petaflops with the equivalent of nearly eight petaflops points similarly to other distributed computing projects folding home quantitatively user computing contributions to the project through a credit system each user receives points for completing every work unit but for reliably and rapidly completing units which are exceptionally computationally demanding or are of great scientific priority users who in may be non awarded additional bonus points all units from a given protein project have uniform base credit which is determined by one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released this generates a system of equal pay for equal work and attempts to align credit with the value of the scientific results the points can foster friendly between and teams to compute the most for the project users may receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines users can use a to protect their contributions as they not only allow for the of bonus points but they also separate a user from any policy issues arising from another using that username users can their contributions under a team which the points of all their members a user can start their own team or they can join an existing team but existing points cannot be transferred to a new team or username in some cases a team may have their own community driven sources of help or such as an internet forum between teams benefit the folding community and members can have team for top spots individual and team statistics are posted on the folding home website software folding home software at the user s end involves three primary components work units cores and a client work units a work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process work units are a fraction of the simulation calculating the rate of transitions between the states in a markov state model the client to a folding home server and a work unit and may also download an appropriate core depending on client settings operating system and underlying hardware architecture after the work unit has been completely processed it is returned and the respective credit points are awarded and this cycle then repeats automatically all work units have associated deadlines and if this deadline is the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically to another as protein folding is serial in nature and many work units are generated from their predecessors this allows the overall simulation process to normally if one is not returned after a certain period of time due to these deadlines the minimum system for folding home is a cpu with or newer however work units for high performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations before public release work units go through several quality steps to problematic ones from becoming fully available these stages include internal testing closed beta testing and open beta testing before a final full release across all of folding home folding home s work units are normally processed only once except in the event that errors occur during processing if this occurs for three different users it is automatically from distribution the folding home support forum can be used to between problematic hardware and a work unit cores specialized scientific computer programs referred to as and often cores perform the calculations on the work unit behind the scenes folding home s cores are modified and optimized versions of molecular dynamics programs including gromacs and most of folding home s cores use gromacs one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages available which largely consists of manually optimized assembly code some of these cores perform explicit atom by atom molecular dynamics calculations while others perform solvation methods which treat atoms as a mathematical continuum while these cores use open source software folding home uses a closed source license and is not required to release the cores source code the same core can be used by various versions of the client and the core from the client enables their scientific methods to be updated automatically as needed without a client the cores also periodically create calculation so that if they are they can work from a upon client folding home participants client programs on their personal computer or on the playstation console the user interacts with the client which manages the other software components behind the scenes through the client the user may the folding process open an event the work progress or view personal statistics the clients run continuously in the background of the user s computer at an extremely low priority otherwise processing power so that normal computer usage is unaffected the maximum cpu utilization can also be adjusted through client settings computer clients to uniprocessor and multi core processors systems as well as graphics processing units while these latter clients use significantly more resources the diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides folding home with the ability to efficiently complete many different types of simulations in a manner in a few or months rather than years which is of significant scientific value together these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions previously considered impossible to tackle computationally significant work into security issues in all of folding home s software for example clients can be only from the official folding home website or its commercial each client will upload and download data only from stanford s folding home data servers over with as an alternative using for verification and will only interact with folding home computer folding home s end user license agreement public access to the client source code for security and scientific reasons thus from a security it in a similar fashion to a web browser but is even more folding home s first client was a screensaver which would run folding home while the computer was not otherwise in use starting in the pande lab collaborated with david anderson to test a client on the open source boinc framework this client was released to closed beta in april however the approach became and was in june boinc s fixed architecture limits the types of project it can accommodate and thus was not appropriate for folding home graphics processing units the specialized hardware of gpus is designed to accelerate rendering of graphics applications such as video and can significantly cpus for certain types of calculations although limited in this makes gpus one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computational platforms as such general purpose gpu computing is the of many scientists and researchers however gpu hardware is difficult to utilize for non graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture such is challenging especially to researchers with limited software development resources to achieve hardware the pande lab s open source openmm library serves as a high level api allowing molecular simulation software to run efficiently on varying architectures without significant modification lower level interface the higher level api with the underlying platform this flexible approach performance nearly equal to hand gpu code and greatly cpu gpus remain folding home s most powerful platform in terms of flops as of may gpu clients account for of the entire project s flop throughput prior to the computational reliability of gpgpu hardware had remained largely unknown and evidence related to the lack of built in error detection and correction in gpu memory reliability the pande lab then the first large scale test of gpu scientific accuracy on over hosts on the folding home network soft errors were detected in the memory subsystems of two of the tested gpus the study found that the error rate was most dependent on board architecture but concluded that reliable gpgpu computing was very feasible as long as attention is to the hardware characteristics the first generation of folding home s windows gpu client was released to the public on october a speedup for certain calculations over its cpu based gromacs it was the first time gpus had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations pande lab gained significant knowledge and experience with the development of gpgpu software but a need to improve scientific over it was succeeded by the second generation successor of the client on april following its introduction was officially on june compared to was more scientifically reliable and productive on and cuda enabled nvidia gpus and supported more advanced algorithms larger proteins and real time visualization of the protein simulation following this the third generation of folding home s gpu client was released on may while to is more stable and efficient is more flexible for additional scientific capabilities and uses openmm on top of an framework although the gpu client does not support the linux operating system it can be run under for users with nvidia graphics playstation folding home can also take advantage of the computing power of playstation at the time of its and for certain calculations its main cell processor a speed increase over processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the the s high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for and significantly changed the between computational efficiency and overall accuracy allowing for the utilization of more complex molecular models at little extra computational cost this allowed folding home to run biomedical calculations that would otherwise be computationally the also has the ability to stream data quickly to its gpu and is capable of real time atomic detail visualizations of the protein dynamics the client was developed in a collaborative effort between and the pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on march its release made folding home the first distributed computing project to utilize on september of the following year the client became a channel of life with playstation on its launch in terms of the types of calculations it can perform the client takes the middle ground between a cpu s flexibility and a gpu s speed however unlike cpus and gpus users cannot perform other activities on their while running folding home the s uniform console environment makes support easier and makes folding home more user friendly multi core processing client folding home can also utilize the parallel processing capabilities of modern multi core processors the ability to use several cpu cores simultaneously allows completion of the overall folding simulation much faster working together these cpu cores complete single work units faster than the standard uniprocessor client which reduces the traditional of scaling a large simulation to many processors while this approach is not only scientifically valuable the resulting publications would not have been possible without this computing power in november first generation symmetric smp clients were publicly released for open beta testing referred to as these clients used message passing interface mpi communication for parallel processing as at that time the gromacs cores were not designed to be used with multiple this was the first time a distributed computing project had utilized mpi as it had previously been only for supercomputers represented a landmark in the simulation of protein folding although the clients performed well in based operating systems such as linux and mac s os x they were particularly in windows on january the second generation of the smp clients and the successor to was released as an open beta and replaced the complex mpi with a more reliable based also supports a trial of a special category of bigadv work units designed for proteins that are large and computationally intensive but have a great scientific priority these units originally required a minimum of eight cpu cores but on february this was increased to cpu cores compared to standard units run on these also require more system resources such as and internet bandwidth but users who run these are with a increase over s bonus point system the bigadv category allows folding home to run particularly demanding simulations on long timescales that had previously required the use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed on folding home the client is the and latest generation of the folding home client software and is a complete and of the previous clients for microsoft windows mac os x and linux operating systems like its predecessors can also run folding home in the background at a very low priority allowing other applications to use cpu resources as they need it is designed to make the start up and user friendly for as well as offers greater scientific flexibility than previous clients uses for managing its so that users can see its development process and provide feedback it was officially released on march consists of three elements the user interacts with s known as fahcontrol it has advanced and user interface modes and has the ability to monitor and control many folding clients from a single computer fahcontrol can monitor and direct which behind the scenes and in turn manages each or slot these act as for the previously distinct folding home computer clients as they may be of uniprocessor smp or gpu type each slot also contains a core and data associated with it and can download process and upload work units independently the function modeled after the s displays a real time rendering if available of the protein currently being processed comparison to other molecular systems rosetta home is a distributed computing project at protein structure prediction and is one of the most accurate tertiary structure available as rosetta only predicts the final folded state and not how proteins fold rosetta home and folding home address very different molecular questions the pande lab can use the conformational states from rosetta s software in a markov state model as starting points for folding home simulations conversely structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations thus folding home and rosetta home perform complementary work anton is a special purpose supercomputer constructed for molecular dynamics simulations it is unique in its ability to produce individual ultra long molecular trajectories on biological timescales these simulations while computationally expensive contain more phase space than any one of folding home s many shorter trajectories like folding home it has also improved several long held theories of protein folding as of october anton and folding home are the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems and anton has also run individual simulations out to the range in the pande lab built a markov state model from a anton simulation the publication demonstrated that an msm built from serial data revealed folding information unobtainable with traditional approaches and that there was little difference between markov models constructed from anton s fewer long trajectories or one assembled from folding home s many shorter trajectories starting in june folding home began additional sampling of an anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its techniques compare to anton s more traditional methods it is that a combination of anton s and folding home s simulation methods would provide a well simulation over long timescales note supercomputer flop performance is assessed by running the linpack benchmark this short term testing has difficulty in accurately reflecting sustained performance on real world tasks because linpack more efficiently maps to supercomputer hardware computing systems also vary in architecture and design so direct comparison is difficult despite this flops remain the primary speed used in supercomputing folding home measures its work using wall time a more accurate method of determining actual performance,Science,48
K-mer Experimental_physics Science,the term k mer or x mer where x can be virtually any of choice usually refers to a specific n or n of acid or amino acid sequences that can be used to identify certain regions within like dna e g for gene prediction or proteins either k mer as such can be used for finding regions of interest or k mer statistics giving discrete probability distributions of a number of possible k mer combinations or rather with are used specific short k mers are called oligomers or oligos for short,Science,49

Foldit Experimental_physics Science,foldit is an online puzzle video game about protein folding the game is part of an experimental research project and is developed by the university of washington s center for game science in collaboration with the department of biochemistry the objective of the game is to fold the structure of selected proteins to the best of the s ability using various tools provided within the game the highest solutions are by researchers who determine whether or not there is a native structural configuration or native state that can be applied to the relevant proteins in the real world scientists can then use such solutions to solve real world problems by and diseases and creating biological history rosetta david baker a protein research scientist at the university of washington is responsible for beginning the foldit project prior to the project s baker and his laboratory co workers upon another research project rosetta to predict the native structures of various proteins using special computer protein structure prediction algorithms the project was eventually extended to utilize the processing power of user s personal computers by developing a distributed computing program rosetta home the rosetta home program was made available for public download and was designed to display progress of a particular protein being worked on at the time as a screensaver the results of the program s prediction routines are sent to a central project server for verification some users of rosetta home became with the program when they realised they could see ways of solving the protein structures themselves but could not interact with the program when baker realised that humans could have considerable potential over computers to solve protein structures he david a computer scientist and a game designer studying at the same university to help and build an interactive program that would both to the public and assist in their efforts to find the native structures of proteins a game foldit many of the same people who created rosetta home worked on the construction of foldit the public beta version was released in may and has players since the foldit project has in critical assessment of techniques for protein structure prediction casp experiments its best solutions to targets based on unknown protein structures casp is an international experiment which aims to assess existing methods of protein structure prediction and highlight research that may be more productive toward solving protein structures goals protein structure prediction is important in several fields of science including bioinformatics molecular biology and medicine successful identification of the structural configuration of natural proteins enables scientists to study and understand proteins better this can lead toward the creation of novel proteins by design in the treatment of diseases and the development of solutions for other real world problems such as species and pollution the process by which living create the primary structure of proteins protein biosynthesis is well understood as is the means by which proteins are as dna determining how the primary structure of a protein into a three dimensional the molecule folds more difficult the general process is known but protein structure prediction is computationally demanding methods similar to rosetta home david baker and his team of co workers aim to use foldit as a means of native protein structures faster through a combination of crowdsourcing and distributed computing however there is a greater on crowdsourcing and community collaboration with the foldit project other methods such as virtual interaction and gamification were added creating a unique and innovative project environment with the potential to greatly assist the cause virtual interaction foldit attempts to apply the human brain s natural three dimensional pattern matching and spatial to help solve the problem of protein structure prediction current puzzles are based on well understood proteins by the ways in which humans approach these puzzles researchers hope to improve the algorithms employed by existing protein folding software foldit provides a series of in which the user simple protein like structures and a periodically updated set of puzzles based on real proteins the application displays a graphical representation of the protein s structure which the user is able to with the aid of a set of tools gamification rather than just building a useful science tool the developers of foldit focused on designing a program that the concept of gamification the aim was to make the program more and to a public audience in order to more people to the cause of protein folding this was especially true for those people that did not have a scientific education or background as the structure is modified a is calculated based on how well folded the protein is and a list of high scores for each puzzle is maintained foldit users may create and join groups and share puzzle solutions with each other a separate list of group high scores is maintained future development the is primarily for the design of protein molecules the game announced the plan to add the chemical building blocks with organic to enable the foldit players to design small molecules by,Science,51

bioinformatics founded in the society s core mission is to contribute to the scientific understanding of living systems through computation iscb seeks to communicate the significance of computational biology to the larger scientific community to organizations and to the general public the society serves its members and internationally it provides for scientific publications meetings and information through multiple platforms iscb the intelligent systems for molecular biology ismb conference every year a growing number of smaller more or focused annual and bi annual conferences and has two official journals plos computational biology and bioinformatics the society two each year the overton prize and the by a scientist award and it to members that have distinguished themselves through contributions to the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics iscb leadership a president an executive committee and a board of directors comprise iscb s scientific leadership drawing on distinguished internationally renowned researchers who are elected for their term by the general society membership the executive leads the iscb staff and supports a diverse set of dedicated to specific issues that are important to the computational biology and bioinformatics community including education policy and publications aims iscb has the following aims conferences iscb grew out of the need for a stable organizational structure to support the planning and manage the finances of the intelligent systems for molecular biology ismb conference series which had its start in ismb is iscb s most prominent annual activity toward which a significant portion of resources are dedicated each year since when ismb is held in europe it is held with the european conference on computational biology eccb iscb began expanding its conference offerings with the introduction of the annual rocky mountain bioinformatics conference series in the annual conference on semantics in healthcare and life sciences cshals in the bi annual iscb africa asbcb conference on bioinformatics in and the bi annual iscb latin america conference in future plans include the development of an iscb asia conference in addition to iscb organized conferences the society supports other computational biology and bioinformatics conferences through and these include the annual pacific on or the annual international conference on research in computational molecular biology or the annual asia pacific bioinformatics network s international conference on computational biology or and the annual general meeting of the european molecular biology network or affiliated organizations africa asia europe and middle north america south america overview in the ismb conference committee thought it would be useful to start a scientific society focused on managing all scientific organizational and financial aspects of the ismb conference and to provide a forum for scientists to address the emerging role of computers in the biological sciences the international society for computational biology iscb was legally in the us in with currently director of the center for computational pharmacology at the university of colorado school of medicine and the university s computational program elected as its president by the members of the founding board of directors russ altman glasgow peter overton david david states and during the next few years the focus remained on management of the annual ismb conference whose attendance of approximately researchers had more than tripled by that year bioinformatics previously published as by oxford university press became the official journal of the iscb members of the society gained two of membership ismb conference registration and an online subscription to the journal the new brought in a new president in russ altman currently chair of stanford university s department of and director of the program in biomedical informatics and over attended ismb in san diego altman took steps to some of the and aspects of iscb before passing the in to e bourne currently professor in the department of pharmacology and school of and pharmaceutical sciences at the university of california san diego bourne gave iscb a more home at ucsd which included the university s to host the society through at least and its offer of staff support although bourne served as president for only one year he left his mark on the society by increasing the interaction with regional groups and conference organizers worldwide and through an improved web presence during his tenure membership grew to more than researchers and the ismb conference in canada over attendees in iscb vice president initiated the affiliated regional groups program to promote relationship building among bioinformatics groups worldwide the program offers a structure for mutual recognition and information exchange between the iscb and other bioinformatics groups so they can cross promote and events in the fall of the first european conference on computational biology eccb was held in germany which iscb supported through student travel and many iscb members and attended michael gribskov then at ucsd s san diego supercomputer department and now at the department of biological sciences at university was elected president in that year ismb took place in which was the first time the meeting was held outside north america or europe this phase brought many for the society when attendance to one half of expectations due to travel and related to of or the start of the war in and the location which with the pattern of north american and european venues although scientifically successful the financial losses of ismb left iscb for the first time in its history in part to iscb s dependence on ismb proceeds to the society s activities and annual overhead costs a pilot regional conference was in the us to gauge interest in smaller localized meetings in december the rocky mountain regional bioinformatics conference rocky was launched in colorado the meeting has been held ever since and now attendees from around the world in ismb eccb and

the society moved to an online subscription plan for members since many scientists worked and studied at institutions that already held subscriptions therefore the need for individual subscriptions for all members that year also the launch of the iscb student council which opportunities of and young researchers working in computational biology and bioinformatics during an in phil bourne s lab while still a phd student now a scientist at the sanger institute developed the idea for a student council to give leadership opportunities and encourage among student members worldwide and was elected as its first council chair in in as part of the society s about the role of publications and the society s official journal by the advent of open access the iscb announced a partnership with the public library of science and launched a new open access journal plos computational biology the journal is intended to computational methods applied to living systems at all scales from molecular biology to populations and and which offer insight for experimentalists past president and past publications committee chair phil bourne served as the new publication s editor in and he remains in that role the first issue of the new journal with the day of ismb held in in ismb again ventured away from the pattern of north american and european venues by place in in collaboration with the association for bioinformatics and computational biology or once again the conference was a scientific success and included new tracks to encourage participation of experimentalists as well as computer scientists but attendance was approximately half of the previous year which negatively the society finances that had not yet recovered from the losses of membership for the year did not as as

De_novo_transcriptome_assembly Experimental_physics Science,de novo transcriptome assembly is the method of creating a transcriptome without the aid of a reference genome introduction before the development of de novo transcriptome assembly transcriptome information was only available for a of model organisms utilized by the international scientific research community since sequencing was very costly even just five years ago only transcriptomes of organisms that were of broad interest and to scientific research were sequenced with the advent of high throughput sequencing also called next generation sequencing technologies that are both cost and effective it is now possible to expand the range of organisms studied via these methods within the past few years transcriptomes have been created for as well as the brains of the the the and the red to name just a few non model organisms can provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the of that have enabled the abundance of life on planet earth in and the that cannot be examined in common model organisms include and de novo transcriptome assembly is often the method to studying non model organisms since it is and easier than building a genome and reference based methods are not possible without an existing genome the transcriptomes of these organisms can thus reveal novel proteins and their isoforms that are implicated in such unique biological phenomena de novo vs reference based assembly a set of assembled transcripts allows for initial gene expression studies prior to the development of transcriptome assembly computer programs transcriptome data were analyzed primarily by mapping on to a reference genome though genome alignment is a robust way of characterizing transcript sequences this method is by its to account for of structural alterations of mrna transcripts such as alternative splicing since a genome contains the sum of all introns and exons that may be present in a transcript spliced variants that align continuously along the genome may be as actual protein isoforms transcriptome vs genome assembly unlike genome sequence coverage levels which can vary as a result of content in non coding intron regions of dna transcriptome sequence coverage levels can be directly indicative of gene expression levels these repeated sequences also create ambiguities in the formation of contigs in genome assembly while ambiguities in transcriptome assembly contigs usually correspond to spliced isoforms or minor variation among members of a gene family method rna seq once mrna is extracted and from cells it is sent to a high throughput sequencing facility where it is first transcribed to create a cdna library this cdna can then be into various lengths depending on the platform used for sequencing each of the following platforms utilizes a different type of technology to sequence millions of short reads sequencing and solid assembly algorithms the cdna sequence reads are assembled into transcripts via a short read transcript assembly program most likely some amino acid variations among transcripts that are otherwise similar reflect different protein isoforms it is also possible that they represent different genes within the same gene family or even genes that share only a conserved domain depending on the degree of variation a number of assembly programs are available see assemblers although these programs have been generally successful in assembling genomes transcriptome assembly some unique challenges whereas high sequence coverage for a genome may indicate the presence of repetitive sequences and thus be for a transcriptome they may indicate abundance in addition unlike genome sequencing transcriptome sequencing can be specific due to the possibility of both sense and antisense transcripts finally it can be difficult to reconstruct and apart all splicing isoforms short read assemblers generally use one of two basic algorithms overlap graphs and de bruijn graphs overlap graphs are utilized for most assemblers designed for sanger sequenced reads the between each pair of reads is computed and compiled into a in which each represents a single sequence read this algorithm is more computationally intensive than de bruijn graphs and most effective in assembling fewer reads with a high degree of overlap de bruijn graphs align k mers usually based on k sequence conservation to create contigs the use of k mers which are shorter than the read lengths in de bruijn graphs reduces the computational intensity of this method functional annotation functional annotation of the assembled transcripts allows for insight into the particular molecular functions cellular components and biological processes in which the proteins are involved enables gene based data mining to annotate sequence data for which no go annotation is available yet it is a research tool often employed in functional genomics research on non model species it works by assembled contigs against a non redundant nucleotide database then them based on sequence similarity is another go annotation program specific for and plant gene products that works in a similar fashion it is part of the database of publicly of computational tools for go annotation and analysis following annotation of genes and genomes enables visualization of pathways and molecular interaction networks in the transcriptome in addition to being for go terms contigs can also be for open frames in order to predict the amino acid sequence of proteins derived from these transcripts another approach is to annotate protein domains and determine the presence of gene families rather than specific genes verification and quality control since a reference genome is not available the quality of computer assembled contigs may be verified by aligning the sequences of conserved gene domains found in mrna transcripts to transcriptomes or genomes of closely related species another method is to design pcr for predicted transcripts then attempt to them from the cdna library exceptionally short reads are out short sequences amino acids are to represent functional proteins as they are unable to fold independently and form hydrophobic cores assemblers the following is a partial of assembly software that has been used to generate transcriptomes and has also been in scientific literature velvet the velvet algorithm uses de bruijn graphs to assemble transcripts in simulations velvet can produce contigs up to kb length using data and kb in bacterial artificial chromosomes these transcripts are transferred to which uses paired end read and long read information to build transcript isoforms trans abyss abyss is a parallel paired end sequence trans abyss assembly by short sequences is a software pipeline written in python and perl for analyzing abyss assembled transcriptome contigs this pipeline can be applied to generated across a wide range of k values it first reduces the into smaller sets of non redundant contigs and identifies splicing events including exon novel exons introns novel introns and alternative splicing the trans abyss algorithms are also able to estimate gene expression levels identify potential sites as well as candidate gene fusion events,Science,63

Pride & Prejudice Chapter 13 Jane Austen,with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted in mrs dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in marianne's and elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances in hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve in spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period as capable of attaching her and his behaviour declared his wishes,Jane Austen,76

Pride & Prejudice Chapter 16 Jane Austen,injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by willoughby and marianne who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits brandon is just the kind of man said willoughby one day when they were talking of him together whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers to talk to that is exactly what i think of him cried marianne do not boast of it however said elinor for it is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him that he is patronised by you replied willoughby is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command the indifference of any body else but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and marianne will make amends for the regard of lady middleton and her mother if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning than you are prejudiced and unjust in defence of your protege you can even be saucy my protege as you call him is a sensible man and sense will always have attractions for me yes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind i have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good breeding and good nature that is to say cried marianne contemptuously he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome he would have told me so i,Jane Austen,79
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 17 Jane Austen,doubt not had i made any such inquiries but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed perhaps said willoughby his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour but why should you dislike him i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary as a very respectable man who has every body's good word and nobody's notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to employ and two new coats every year add to which cried marianne that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice no,Jane Austen,80
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 18 Jane Austen,expression you decide on his imperfections so much in the mass replied elinor and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation i am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart miss dashwood cried willoughby you are now using me unkindly you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever chapter 11 little had mrs dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into devonshire that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment yet such was the case when marianne was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir john had been previously forming were put into execution the private balls at the park then began and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery october would allow in every meeting of the kind willoughby was included and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne of marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her affection elinor could not be surprised at their attachment she only wished that it were less openly shewn and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self command to marianne but marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common place and mistaken notions willoughby thought the same and their behaviour at all times was an illustration of their opinions when he was present she had no eyes for any one else every thing he did was right every thing he said was clever if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners,Jane Austen,81
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 19 Jane Austen,for half the time and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame and seemed hardly to provoke them mrs dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind this was the season of happiness to marianne her heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment to norland which she brought with her from sussex was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home elinor's happiness was not so great her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret,Jane Austen,82

Pride & Prejudice Chapter 21 Jane Austen,were always the same and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys in colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion willoughby was out of the question her admiration and regard even her sisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover his attentions were wholly marianne's and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing colonel brandon unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of marianne and in conversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister elinor's compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been,Jane Austen,84
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 22 Jane Austen,known to him this suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park when they were sitting down together by mutual consent while the others were dancing his eyes were fixed on marianne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile your sister i understand does not approve of second attachments no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist i believe she does but how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are by any body but herself this will probably be the case he replied and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to,Jane Austen,85
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 23 Jane Austen,see them give way to the reception of more general opinions i cannot agree with you there said elinor there are inconveniences attending such feelings as marianne's which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment or is it equally criminal in every body are those who have been disappointed in their first choice whether from the inconstancy of its object or the perverseness of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives upon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment's being pardonable this said he cannot hold but a change a total,Jane Austen,86
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 24 Jane Austen,change of sentiments no no do not desire it for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too dangerous i speak from experience i once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister who thought and judged like her but who from an inforced change from a series of unfortunate circumstances here he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not otherwise have entered elinor's head the lady would probably have passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips as it was it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard elinor attempted no more but marianne in her place would not have done so little the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love chapter 12 as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated,Jane Austen,87
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 25 Jane Austen,a piece of news to her sister which in spite of all that she knew before of marianne's imprudence and want of thought surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both marianne told her with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman without considering that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable to receive them she had accepted the present without hesitation and told her sister of it in raptures he intends to send his groom into somersetshire immediately for it she added and when it arrives we will ride every day you shall share its use with me,Jane Austen,88
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 26 Jane Austen,imagine to yourself my dear elinor the delight of a gallop on some of these downs most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair and for some time she refused to submit to them as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle mama she was sure would never object to it and any horse would do for him he might always get one at the park as to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little or at least so lately known to her this was too much you are mistaken elinor said she warmly in supposing i know very little of willoughby i have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and mama it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy it is disposition alone seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others i should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother than from willoughby of john i know,Jane Austen,89
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 27 Jane Austen,very little though we have lived together for years but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more she knew her sister's temper opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion but by an appeal to her affection for her mother by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she consented to this increase of establishment marianne was shortly subdued and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell willoughby when she saw him next that it must be declined she was faithful to her word and when willoughby called at the cottage the same day elinor heard her express her disappointment to,Jane Austen,90
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 28 Jane Austen,him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible his concern however was very apparent and after expressing it with earnestness he added in the same low voice but marianne the horse is still yours though you cannot use it now i shall keep it only till you can claim it when you leave barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home queen mab shall receive you this was all overheard by miss dashwood and in the whole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning so direct as marked a perfect agreement between them from that moment,Jane Austen,91
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 29 Jane Austen,she doubted not of their being engaged to each other and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she or any of their friends should be left by tempers so frank to discover it by accident margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them and margaret by being left some time in the parlour with only him and marianne had had opportunity for observations which with a most important face she communicated to her eldest sister when they were next by themselves oh elinor she cried i have such a secret to tell you about marianne i am sure she will be married to mr willoughby very soon you have said so replied elinor almost every day since they first met on high church down and they had not known each other a week i believe before you were certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle but indeed this is quite another thing i am sure they will be married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair take care margaret it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his but indeed elinor it is marianne's i am almost sure it is for i saw him cut it off last night after tea when you and mama went out of the room they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be,Jane Austen,92
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 30 Jane Austen,and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket book for such particulars stated on such authority elinor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister when mrs jennings attacked her one evening at the park to give the name of the young man who was,Jane Austen,93

Pride & Prejudice Chapter 32 Jane Austen,not tell ma'am but i know very well what it is and i know where he is too yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house at norland to be sure he is the curate of the parish i dare say no that he is not he is of no profession at all margaret said marianne with great warmth you know that all this is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence well then he is lately dead marianne for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing at this moment that it rained very hard though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her than from her ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother the idea however started by her was immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was on,Jane Austen,95

Pride & Prejudice Chapter 34 Jane Austen,party of pleasure to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking considering the time of year and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight and mrs dashwood who had already a cold was persuaded by elinor to stay at home chapter 13 their intended excursion to whitwell turned out very different from what elinor had expected she was prepared to be wet through fatigued and frightened but the event was still more unfortunate for they did not go at all by ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park where they were to breakfast the morning was rather favourable though it had rained all night as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky and the sun frequently appeared they were all in high spirits and good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in among the rest there was one for colonel brandon he took it looked at the direction changed colour and immediately left the room what is the matter with brandon said sir john nobody could tell i hope he has had no bad news said lady middleton it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon,Jane Austen,97
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 35 Jane Austen,leave my breakfast table so suddenly in about five minutes he returned no bad news colonel i hope said mrs jennings as soon as he entered the room none at all ma'am i thank you was it from avignon i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse no ma'am it came from town and is merely a letter of business but how came the hand to discompose you so much if it was only a letter of business come come this won't do colonel so let us hear the truth of it my dear madam said lady middleton recollect what you are saying perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny is married said mrs jennings without attending to her daughter's reproof no indeed it is not well then i know who it is from colonel and i hope she is well whom do you mean ma'am said he colouring a little oh you know who i mean i am particularly sorry ma'am said he addressing lady middleton that i should receive this letter today for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town in town cried mrs jennings what can you have to do in town at this time of year my own loss is great he continued in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at whitwell what a blow upon them all was this but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon said marianne,Jane Austen,98
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 36 Jane Austen,eagerly will it not be sufficient he shook his head we must go said sir john it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow brandon that is all i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day if you would but let us know what your business is said mrs jennings we might see whether it could be put off or not you would not be six hours later said willoughby if you were to defer your journey till our return i cannot afford to lose one hour elinor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marianne there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure brandon is one of them he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it i would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing i have no doubt of it replied marianne there is no persuading you to change your mind brandon i know of old said,Jane Austen,99
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 37 Jane Austen,sir john when once you are determined on anything but however i hope you will think better of it consider here are the two miss careys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods walked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell colonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable well then when will you come back again i hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to whitwell till you return you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it,Jane Austen,100
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 38 Jane Austen,at all oh he must and shall come back cried sir john if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him ay so do sir john cried mrs jennings and then perhaps you may find out what his business is i do not want to pry into other men's concerns i suppose it is something he is ashamed of colonel brandon's horses were announced you do not go to town on horseback do you added sir john no only to honiton i shall then go post well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey but you had better change your mind i,Jane Austen,101
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 39 Jane Austen,assure you it is not in my power he then took leave of the whole party is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter miss dashwood i am afraid none at all then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do to marianne he merely bowed and said nothing come colonel said mrs jennings before you go do let us know what you are going about he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john left the room the complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed i can guess what his business is however said mrs jennings exultingly can you ma'am said almost every body yes it is about miss williams i am sure and who is miss williams asked marianne what do not you know who miss,Jane Austen,102
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 40 Jane Austen,williams is i am sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation of the colonel's my dear a very near relation we will not say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies then lowering her voice a little she said to elinor she is his natural daughter indeed oh yes and as like him as she can stare i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event concluding however by observing that as they were all got together they must do something by way of being happy and after some consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country the carriages were then ordered willoughby's was first and marianne never looked happier than when she got into it he drove through the park very fast and they were soon out of sight and nothing more of them was seen till their return which,Jane Austen,103
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 41 Jane Austen,did not happen till after the return of all the rest they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the downs it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that every body should be extremely merry all day long some more of the careys came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment willoughby took his usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods mrs jennings sat on elinor's right hand and they had not been long seated before she leant behind her and willoughby and said to marianne loud enough for them both to hear i have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you spent the morning marianne coloured and replied very hastily where pray did not you know said willoughby that we had been out in my curricle yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and i was determined to find out where you had been to i hope you like your house miss marianne it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago marianne turned away in great confusion mrs jennings laughed heartily and elinor found,Jane Austen,104
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 42 Jane Austen,that in her resolution to know where they had been she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr willoughby's groom and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house elinor could hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose or marianne consent to enter the house while mrs smith was in it with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance as soon as they left the dining room elinor enquired of her about it and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs jennings was perfectly true marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that we did not see the house is not it what you have often wished to do yourself yes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith was there and with no other companion than,Jane Austen,105
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 43 Jane Austen,mr willoughby mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life i am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have been sensible of it at the time for we always know when we are acting wrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation i am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs smith's grounds or in seeing her house they will one day be mr willoughby's and if they were one day to be your own marianne you would not be justified in what you have done she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying to her and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her sister again and said with great good humour perhaps elinor it was rather ill judged in me to go to allenham but mr willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house i assure you there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would be delightful it is a corner room and has windows on two sides on one side you look across the bowling green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood and on the other you have a view of the church and village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired i did not see it to advantage for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture but if it were newly fitted up a couple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of the pleasantest summer rooms in england could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others she would have described every room in the house with equal delight chapter 14 the sudden termination of colonel brandon's visit at the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs jennings for two or three days she was a great wonderer as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance she wondered with little intermission what could be the,Jane Austen,106
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 44 Jane Austen,reason of it was sure there must be some bad news and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure said she i could see it in his face poor man i am afraid his circumstances may be bad the estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved i do think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can it be i wonder whether it is so i would give anything to know the truth of it perhaps it is about miss williams and by the bye i dare say it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her may be she is ill in town nothing in the world more likely for i have a notion she is always rather sickly i would lay any wager it is about miss williams it is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances now for he is a very prudent man and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time i wonder what it can be may be his sister is worse,Jane Austen,107
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 45 Jane Austen,at avignon and has sent for him over his setting off in such a hurry seems very like it well i wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain so wondered so talked mrs jennings her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose elinor though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel brandon could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away which mrs jennings was desirous of her feeling for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby on the subject which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all as this silence continued every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant behaviour,Jane Austen,108
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 46 Jane Austen,to each other declared to have taken place elinor could not imagine she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power for though willoughby was independent there was no reason to believe him rich his estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven hundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained of his poverty but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement which in fact concealed nothing at all she could not account and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all than willoughby's behaviour to marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his favourite pointer at her feet one evening in particular about a week after colonel brandon left the country his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around,Jane Austen,109
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 47 Jane Austen,him and on mrs dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him what he exclaimed improve this dear cottage no that i will never consent to not a stone must be added to its walls not an inch to its size if my feelings are regarded do not be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of the kind will be done for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it i am heartily glad of it he cried may she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better thank you willoughby but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements in the world depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you but are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it i am said he to me it is faultless nay more i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose said elinor yes cried he in the same eager tone with all and every thing belonging to it in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least variation be perceptible then and then only under such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton i flatter myself replied elinor that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this there certainly are circumstances said willoughby which might greatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share mrs dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby as plainly denoted how well she understood him how often did i wish added he when i was at allenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring,Jane Austen,110
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 48 Jane Austen,its situation and grieving that no one should live in it how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so marianne speaking to her in a lowered voice then continuing his former tone he said and yet this house you would spoil mrs dashwood you would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford mrs dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted you are a good woman he warmly replied your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that,Jane Austen,111
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 49 Jane Austen,i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me the promise was readily given and willoughby's behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness shall we see you tomorrow to dinner said mrs dashwood when he was leaving them i do not ask you to come in the morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady middleton he engaged to be with them by four o'clock chapter 15 mrs dashwood's visit to lady middleton took place the next day and two of her daughters went with her but marianne excused herself from being of the party under some trifling pretext of employment and her mother who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home on their return from the park they found willoughby's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage and mrs dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just so far it was all as she had foreseen but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect they were no sooner in the passage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into,Jane Austen,112
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 50 Jane Austen,the room she had just quitted where they found only willoughby who was leaning against the mantel piece with his back towards them he turned round on their coming in and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over powered marianne is anything the matter with her cried mrs dashwood as she entered is she ill i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forced smile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be ill for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment disappointment yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on business to london i have just received my dispatches and taken my farewell of allenham and by way of exhilaration i am now come to take my farewell of you to london and are you going this morning almost this moment this is very unfortunate but mrs smith must be obliged and her business will not detain you from us long i hope he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into devonshire immediately my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth and is,Jane Austen,113
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 51 Jane Austen,mrs smith your only friend is allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome for shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here his colour increased and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied you are too good mrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise elinor felt equal amazement for a few moments every one was silent mrs dashwood first spoke i have only to add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not press you to return here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination my engagements at present replied willoughby confusedly are of such a nature that i dare not flatter myself he stopt mrs dashwood was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded this was broken by willoughby who said with a faint smile it is folly to linger in this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room they,Jane Austen,114
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 52 Jane Austen,saw him step into his carriage and in a minute it was out of sight mrs dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mother's invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himself greatly disturbed her one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister the distress in which marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for though when she considered what marianne's love for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible but whatever might be the particulars of their separation her sister's affliction was indubitable and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a duty in about half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor said she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart does he travel it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice gone too without intending to return something more than what he owned to us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like himself you must,Jane Austen,115
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 53 Jane Austen,have seen the difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here it was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could plainly see that he had not the power of accepting it i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you can you indeed yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you elinor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy you i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded that mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne disapproves of it perhaps because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes and absent himself from devonshire for a while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this and now elinor what have you to say nothing for you have anticipated my answer then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery for marianne and,Jane Austen,116
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 54 Jane Austen,guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for the latter you are resolved to think him blameable because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no probabilities to be accepted merely because they are not certainties is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves though unavoidably secret for a while and after all what is it you suspect him of i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has but it would,Jane Austen,117
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 55 Jane Austen,have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him do not blame him however for departing from his character where the deviation is necessary but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence i am happy and he is acquitted not entirely it may be proper to conceal their engagement if they are engaged from mrs smith and if that is the case it must be highly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us concealing it from us my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment this is strange indeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness i want no proof of their affection said elinor but of their engagement i do i am perfectly satisfied of both yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject by either of them i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly has not his behaviour to marianne and to all of us for at least the last fortnight declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation have we not perfectly understood each other has not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner his attentive and affectionate respect my elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement how could such a thought,Jane Austen,118
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 56 Jane Austen,occur to you how is it to be supposed that willoughby persuaded as he must be of your sister's love should leave her and leave her perhaps for months without telling her of his affection that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence i confess replied elinor that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other how strange this is you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time do you suppose him really indifferent to her no i cannot think that he must and does love her i am sure but with a strange kind of tenderness if he can leave her with such indifference such carelessness of the future as you attribute to him you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter as certain i have had my doubts i confess but they are fainter than they were and they may soon be entirely done away if we find they correspond every fear of mine will be removed a mighty concession indeed if you were to see them at the altar you would suppose they were going to be married ungracious girl but i require no such proof nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt no secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open and unreserved you cannot doubt your sister's wishes it must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect but why is he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful i hope not i believe not cried elinor i love willoughby sincerely love him,Jane Austen,119
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 57 Jane Austen,and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me it has been involuntary and i will not encourage it i was startled i confess by the alteration in his manners this morning he did not speak like himself and did not return your kindness with any cordiality but all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed he had just parted from my sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction and if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith to resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet aware that by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away for some time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character but i will not,Jane Austen,120
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 58 Jane Austen,raise objections against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent you speak very properly willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected though we have not known him long he is no stranger in this part of the world and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable they were interrupted by the entrance of margaret and elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother to acknowledge the probability of many and hope for the justice of all they saw nothing of marianne till dinner time when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word her eyes were red and swollen and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty she avoided the looks of them all could neither eat nor speak and after some time on her mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome she burst into tears and left the room this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening she was without,Jane Austen,121
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 59 Jane Austen,any power because she was without any desire of command over herself the slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby overpowered her in an instant and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort it was impossible for them if they spoke at all to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him chapter 16 marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from willoughby she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it but the feelings which made such composure a disgrace left her in no danger of incurring it she was awake the whole night and she wept the greatest part of it she got up with a headache was unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either her sensibility was potent enough when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about the village of allenham indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning the evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling she played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to willoughby every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her till,Jane Austen,122
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 60 Jane Austen,her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained and this nourishment of grief was every day applied she spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying her voice often totally suspended by her tears in books too as well as in music she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving she read nothing but what they had been used to read together such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy but these employments to which she daily recurred her solitary walks and silent meditations still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever no letter from willoughby came and none seemed expected by marianne her mother was surprised and elinor again became uneasy but mrs dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them which at least satisfied herself remember elinor said she how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from the post,Jane Austen,123
Pride & Prejudice Chapter 61 Jane Austen,and carries them to it we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through sir john's hands elinor could not deny the truth of this and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence but there was one method so direct so simple and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair and of instantly removing all mystery that she could not help suggesting it to her mother why do you not ask marianne at once said she whether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a,Jane Austen,124

Eraser Ed Sheeran,i was born inside a small town i've lost that state of mind learned to sing inside the lord's house but stopped at the age of nine i forget when i get awards now the wave i had to ride the paving stones i played upon they kept me on the grind so blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride and when the world's against me is when i really come alive and everyday that satan tempts me i try to take it in my stride you know that i've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs i think life has got to the point i know without it's no fun i need to get in the right mind and clear myself up instead i look in the mirror questioning what i've become i guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me without a nine to five job or an uni degree to be caught up in the trappings of the industry they showed me the locked doors i find another use of key and you'll see i'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me but with that said give me one more higher another one to take the sting away i am happy on my own so here i'll stay save your lovin arms for a rainy day and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser i used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs i chased the pictured perfect life i think they painted it wrong i think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell relationships and hearts you fixed they break as well and ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps because you're living your dream man this shit should be fun please know that i'm not trying to preach like i'm reverend run i beg you don't be disappointed with the man i've become our conversations with my father on the a14 age twelve telling me i've gotta chase those dreams now i'm playing for the people dad and they know me with my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans wembley stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou i may have grown up but i hope that damien's proud and to the next generation inspiration's allowed the world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now somehow i'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me but with that said give me one more higher another one to take the sting away i am not beyond my own so here i'll stay save your lovin arms for a rainy day and i'll find comfort in my pain

Nina Ed Sheeran,i met you when i was a teen but then you were one as well and i could play the guitar just like ringing a bell sometimes i wonder and any other summer could you have been my part time lover to me listening to stevie wonder under the covers where we used to lay and re stacks is what the speakers play i’ll be on tour almost every day when i was home up in my flat is where we used to stay just watching the dvd smoking illegal weed getting high as two kites we needed no breathe we used each others edge just for the people to see and stay up all night like when we needed to sleep we go anywhere our minds would take us and also you are beautiful without your make up and you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause we can all be loved the way god made us and time’s the only reason that we could break up cause you would always tell me i'm away too much distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake say it again oh nina you should go nina cause i ain’t ever coming home nina oh won’t you leave me now and i’ve been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that’s you and me both nina oh won’t you leave me now now and every weekend in the winter you’d be wearing my hoodie with draw strings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold taking day trips to the local where we be on the road cause every day when i was away we'd only speak on the phone watching blue planet creating new habits acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish back to the borrow with all the celtics i disappear you call me selfish i understand but i can’t help it i put my job over everything except my family and friends but you’ll be in between forever so i guess we’ll have to take a step back overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications and i’m not saying we should be taking a break just re evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late so we kinda need to deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane but in the day we’ll have to say it again oh nina you should go nina cause i ain’t ever coming home nina oh won’t you leave me now and i’ve been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that’s you and me both nina oh won’t you leave me now now love will come and love will go but you can make it on your own sing that song go oh won’t you leave me now people grow and fall apart but you can mend your broken heart take it back oh oh won’t you leave me now oh nina you should go nina cause i ain’t ever coming home nina oh won’t you leave me now and i’ve been living on the road nina but then again you should know nina cause that’s you and me both nina oh won’t you leave me now now,Ed Sheeran,152

The A Team Ed Sheeran,white lips pale face breathing in snowflakes burnt lungs sour taste light's gone day's end struggling to pay rent long nights strange men and they say she's in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us cos we're just under the upperhand and go mad for a couple of grams and she don't want to go outside tonight and in a pipe she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly angels to fly ripped gloves raincoat tried to swim and stay afloat dry house wet clothes loose change bank notes weary eyed dry throat cool girl no phone and they say she's in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us cos we're just under the upperhand and go mad for a couple of grams and she don't want to go outside tonight and in a pipe she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly angels to fly and they say she's in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since 18 but lately her face seems slowly sinking wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us cos we're just under the upperhand and go mad for a couple of grams and she don't want to go outside tonight and in a pipe she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly for angels to fly to fly for angels to die,Ed Sheeran,167
Take It Back Ed Sheeran,i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit of spitting quicker lyrics you know you found me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in and never once i get bitten because plagiarism is hidden which i would sit on the rhythm prisoner with a vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio with a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's on to the next saga we drink the best lager i never tried to win you over like your stepfather i do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the cane like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 16 years old i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and we've been sleeping at the subway station sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't want to relax but would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i take it back now chorus come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh take it back with the rhythm and blues and my back pack i'll be singing the news trying to act like jack black when i bring him to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i give you the truth through the vocal booth stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start it again at the end of the song still they claiming that i handled it wrong but then i never had an enemy except for nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling with respect i don't know if i'll have it this songs from the heart covering the planet i'll take it back now chorus come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh take it back now now i don't ever want to be perfect cause i'm a singer that you never want to see shirtless i accept the fact that someone's got to win the worst dressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition cause every day some lyrics and a melody can be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly i need to let my liver be and i say it again living life on the edge with a closed hand full of friends is good advice from a man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now chorus come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love oh my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhymes and lies deliver the hype am i just living the lie with this you must know that the number's just sold woah will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget 90 per cent of it when we wake but the other 10 per cent it never fades dreaming dreams day to day goals stay awake loads try to make the cut like the paper or razor blade oh never give up and just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me buskin on the street when it was cold outdoors and now i'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that posties little sister has to babysit that's just a way it is dreams are your own just set your goals and have the utmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know where you will go or where you will be tomorrow,Ed Sheeran,168
Tenerife Ed Sheeran,you look so wonderful in your dress i love your hair like that the way it falls on the side of your neck down your shoulders and back we are surrounded by all of these lights and people who talk too much you've got that kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us and should this be the last thing i see i want you to know it's enough for me cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need i'm so in love so in love so in love so in love you look so beautiful in this light your silhouette over me the way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the tenerife sea and all of the voices surrounding us here they just fade out when you take a breath just say the word and i will disappear into the wilderness and should this be the last thing i see i want you to know it's enough for me cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need i'm so in love so in love so in love so in love lumiere darling lumiere over me x6 and should this be the last thing i see i want you to know it's enough for me cause all that you are is all that i'll ever need i'm so in love so in love so in love love love love so in love you look so wonderful in your dress i loved your hair like that and in the moment i knew you best,Ed Sheeran,169
The Man Ed Sheeran,now i don't wanna hate you just wish you'd never gone for the man and waited two weeks at least before you let him take you i stayed true i kind of knew you liked the dude from private school he's waiting for the time to move i knew he had his eyes on you he's not the right guy for you don't hate me cause i write the truth no i would never lie to you but it was never fine to lose you and what a way to find out it never came from my mouth you never changed your mind but you were just afraid to mind out but f it i won't be changing the subject i love it i'll make your little secret public it's nothing i'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me trapped and i'm lacking sleep fact is you're mad at me because i backtrack so casually you're practically my family if we married then i'll guess you'd have to be but tragically our love just lost the will to live but would i kill to give it one more shot i think not hook i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore recently i tend to zone out up in my headphones to holocene you promised your body but i'm away so much i stay more celibate than in a monastery i'm not cut out for life on the road cause i didn't know i'd miss you this much and at the time we'd just go so sue me i guess i'm not the man that you need ever since you went to uni i've been sofa surfing with a rucksack full of less cash and i guess that could get bad but when i broke the industry that's when i broke your heart i was supposed to chart and celebrate but good things are over fast i know it's hard to deal with and see this i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features then i turn the music off and all i'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus i never really want to believe this got advice from my dad and he told me that family is all i'll ever have and need i guess i'm unaware of it success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore and since you left i've given up my days off it's what i need to stay strong i know you have a day job but mine is 24 7 i feel like writing a book i guess i lied in the hook cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could the irony is if my career and music didn't exist in 6 years yeah you'd probably be my wife with a kid i'm frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and it's just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i'm trying to kill and i'd be writing my will before i'm 27 i'll die from a thrill go down in history as just a wasted talent can i face the challenge or did i make a mistake erasing it's only therapy my thoughts just get ahead of me eventually i'll be fine i know that it was never meant to be either way i guess i'm not prepared but i'll say this these things happen for a reason and you can't change shit take my apology i'm sorry for the honesty but i had to get this off my chest i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't want you no anymore i don't love you baby i don't need you baby i don't wanna love you no anymore,Ed Sheeran,170
